# WFGY Early Stargazers · Hall of Fame

**Every breakthrough project starts with a few believers.**  
This Hall of Fame honors the engineers, hackers, and community builders who starred WFGY in its earliest days.  
Their support is a public signal —  transparent, verifiable, and forever recorded in open source history.

> Thanks to these early believers,  
> WFGY has already earned stars from nearly **20 seasoned developers**,  
> including AI researchers, toolmakers, and OSS veterans across the globe.  
>  
> Your star isn’t just a bookmark —  
> it’s a vote of confidence in a **radically different way to reason**.
