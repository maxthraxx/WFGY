# WFGY Early Stargazers · Hall of Fame

**Every breakthrough project starts with a few believers.**  
This Hall of Fame honors the engineers, hackers, and community builders who starred WFGY in its earliest days.  
Their support is a public signal — transparent, verifiable, and forever recorded in open source history.

> ⚠️ Note: The split between “Major Legends” and “Rising Legends” is **symbolic only**.  
> It reflects open-source footprint (stars, repos, ecosystem), **not absolute influence**.  
> Both groups are equally vital — without Rising Legends, rockets never leave the ground. 🚀
