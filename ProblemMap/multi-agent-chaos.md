# 🧠 Multi-Agent Semantic Chaos

Multi-agent systems often collapse under semantic chaos: agents forget roles, misalign memory, or overwrite each other’s logic paths.

WFGY enables distributed logic systems to stay coherent even under complex delegation and parallel planning.

---

## 💥 Symptoms

- Agents contradict each other or repeat tasks
- Shared memory becomes inconsistent
- No way to trace logic provenance across agents
- Agents begin speaking “incoherent collectives” — no semantic boundary
- State drift or memory overwrite over time

---

## ❌ Why It Happens

- No centralized semantic state model
- Memory is token-based, not logic-based
- No agent-to-agent ΔS tracking
- All agents operate independently with no shared reasoning grammar

---

## ✅ WFGY Solution

WFGY provides cross-agent coherence and traceability via semantic Tree anchoring and role-aware BBMC.

| Problem | WFGY Module | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Memory inconsistency | Semantic Tree + ID stamps | Nodes carry agent tags and version history |
| Role confusion | Role-indexed BBPF | Distinct reasoning paths per agent, tracked |
| Task overlap or conflict | ΔS divergence monitor | Detects logic collision early |
| State overwrite | Memory checkpointing | Agents fork from stable node snapshots |

---

## 🧪 Example Use

> Scenario: *Three autonomous agents plan a rescue mission in simulation, each with overlapping skillsets.*

- Typical framework: Agents loop, contradict orders, overwrite strategy.
- WFGY:
  - Tags each logic branch by agent (`Agent_X/Node_4C`)
  - Tree shows overlap zone and warns of role conflict
  - BBMC filters semantic collisions
  - Final Tree resolves divergent paths into one stable plan

| Cross-agent Tree integration | ✅ Stable |
| ΔS tracking per agent | ✅ Implemented |
| Conflict detection logic | ✅ Active |
| Memory locking and sync | 🔜 In progress |
