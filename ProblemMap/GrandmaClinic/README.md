Got it ‚Äî here is a **clean MVP README (English)** for your `ProblemMap/GrandmaClinic/README.md`.
It follows **the same 1‚Äì16 order as the canonical Problem Map**, and it starts with a simple **semantic firewall intro** (why *before* matters), so beginners understand the motivation **before** the list.

I keep the style ‚Äúgrandma friendly‚Äù (plain text white), with technical notes in `>` gray quotes.

# Grandma Clinic ‚Äî 16 AI Bugs Your Grandma Can Understand

Most AI fixes today happen **after** the model already failed:
you see a wrong answer, then patch it with regex, rerankers, tools, or embeddings.
That feels like firefighting ‚Äî every new bug needs another patch.

**Semantic Firewall means the opposite**:
you check the state **before** generation.
If the signal looks unstable (semantic drift, broken logic, missing schema),
you stop, reset, or redirect.
Only a stable state is allowed to speak.

That is why each bug, once mapped, stays fixed.
It is less like chasing errors, more like installing a smoke alarm in the kitchen:
you prevent the fire before it starts.

# The 16 Bugs (Grandma Clinic Edition)

---

### No.1 Hallucination & Chunk Drift

**Grandma story**
You asked for basil. The waiter keeps bringing cilantro. Looks similar, tastes wrong.

**Real scene**
Retrieval pulls high-scoring but irrelevant chunks.

> **Fix tip**: normalize embeddings, check metric choice (cosine vs L2).
> Doc: `hallucination.md`

---

### No.2 Interpretation Collapse

**Grandma story**
You said ‚Äúwash before cut‚Äù. He heard ‚Äúcut before wash‚Äù. Same vegetables, wrong order.

**Real scene**
Logic misreads a correct chunk and flips the sequence.

> **Fix tip**: insert mid-step checkpoints, reset on drift.
> Doc: `retrieval-collapse.md`

---

### No.3 Long Reasoning Chains

**Grandma story**
Sent him for 3 groceries, he came back with 5 bags of snacks. Goal forgotten.

**Real scene**
Multi-step reasoning drifts off target.

> **Fix tip**: segment, measure Œª diversity, converge later.
> Doc: `context-drift.md`

---

### No.4 Bluffing / Overconfidence

**Grandma story**
He swears this is the best restaurant, but won‚Äôt give the address. You can‚Äôt trust that.

**Real scene**
Confident answers without citations.

> **Fix tip**: citation-first policy.
> Doc: `bluffing.md`

---

### No.5 Semantic ‚â† Embedding

**Grandma story**
White pepper vs black pepper. Same ‚Äúpepper‚Äù word, different flavor.

**Real scene**
Cosine similarity high, meaning misaligned.

> **Fix tip**: normalize vectors, re-weight hybrid retrievers.
> Doc: `embedding-vs-semantic.md`

---

### No.6 Logic Collapse & Recovery

**Grandma story**
Walking alleys, keep hitting the same wall. Just step back and try another lane.

**Real scene**
Dead-end loops, repeating failed steps.

> **Fix tip**: enforce reset after N steps, block illegal paths.
> Doc: `logic-collapse.md`

---

### No.7 Memory Breaks Across Sessions

**Grandma story**
Yesterday you said add salt. Today you ask again if salt is needed. Annoying.

**Real scene**
Session memory lost or overwritten.

> **Fix tip**: pin state keys, replay essentials each turn.
> Doc: `memory-coherence.md`

---

### No.8 Debugging = Black Box

**Grandma story**
Soup tastes bad, but no one wrote down which spice was added. Impossible to know.

**Real scene**
Missing trace IDs, no visibility into retrieval path.

> **Fix tip**: add chunk IDs and store IDs in logs.
> Doc: `retrieval-traceability.md`

---

### No.9 Entropy Collapse

**Grandma story**
Stew simmered too long, everything turned into mushy porridge.

**Real scene**
Attention melts in long contexts.

> **Fix tip**: split into sections, re-anchor mid-window.
> Doc: `entropy-collapse.md`

---

### No.10 Creative Freeze

**Grandma story**
It‚Äôs edible but dull. Like microwaved food, no surprise.

**Real scene**
Outputs too literal, no variation.

> **Fix tip**: force diversity first, then select best.
> Doc: `creative-freeze.md`

---

### No.11 Symbolic Collapse

**Grandma story**
Family recipe reduced to plain words. Every cook interprets differently, flavor gone.

**Real scene**
Equations, tables, code flattened into prose.

> **Fix tip**: preserve symbol channel, don‚Äôt paraphrase.
> Doc: `symbolic-collapse.md`

---

### No.12 Philosophical Recursion

**Grandma story**
He keeps asking ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù while the food gets cold.

**Real scene**
Self-reference loops, paradox recursion.

> **Fix tip**: define base facts before meta reflection.
> Doc: `philosophical-recursion.md`

---

### No.13 Multi-Agent Chaos

**Grandma story**
Two cooks both add salt, soup turns inedible. They grabbed the same spoon.

**Real scene**
Agents overwrite each other‚Äôs memory.

> **Fix tip**: role partitioning, serialized writes.
> Doc: `Multi-Agent_Problems.md`

---

### No.14 Bootstrap Ordering

**Grandma story**
You dropped veggies into a cold pan. No sizzle, all soggy.

**Real scene**
Query runs before index is built.

> **Fix tip**: readiness probes, ingest before queries.
> Doc: `bootstrap-ordering.md`

---

### No.15 Deployment Deadlock

**Grandma story**
Two people block the doorway, each waiting for the other to move. Nobody passes.

**Real scene**
Circular waits in infra migration.

> **Fix tip**: timeout, staged rollout, or read-only fallback.
> Doc: `deployment-deadlock.md`

---

### No.16 Pre-Deploy Collapse

**Grandma story**
First pot burned. Gas off, pot dirty, spices missing. Of course it failed.

**Real scene**
First API call hits missing env var, index not ready, version skew.

> **Fix tip**: pre-flight checklist: ENV + index + schema.
> Doc: `predeploy-collapse.md`

---

# How to Actually Fix

1. Open [Doctor WFGY](https://chatgpt.com/share/68b9b7ad-51e4-8000-90ee-a25522da01d7)
2. Paste your bug or screenshot.
3. Ask: *‚ÄúWhich Problem Map number am I hitting? Show me the Grandma version fix.‚Äù*

The doctor will:

* Map your case to the right number
* Explain in grandma style
* Give the technical reference and minimal repair

## Why this MVP matters

These 16 bugs are **not random**. They are structural, reproducible, and inevitable once you scale an AI pipeline.
With the semantic firewall, you **fix once, and the bug never comes back**.
That is what makes WFGY different: the map is not just a list ‚Äî it is an X-ray, with both the grandma explanation and the technical suture.

üëâ My question back to you:
Do you want me to also create **separate `no01.md` ‚Ä¶ `no16.md` files** under `GrandmaClinic/` (each with story, mapping, fix) so the main README stays lighter and links out, or keep everything inline in one README for the MVP?
