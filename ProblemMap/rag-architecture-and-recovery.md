## 0) Executive summary

RAG failures are rarely a single bug. They are stacked illusions across: OCR → parsing → chunking → embeddings → vector store → retriever → prompt → LLM reasoning.  
WFGY turns this chaos into a **measurable, observable, and repairable** pipeline using three core instruments:

- **ΔS (delta-S)**: semantic stress. Early-warning detector that pinpoints where meaning breaks.  
- **λ_observe (lambda-observe)**: layered observability. Shows _which layer_ diverged and how.  
- **E_resonance**: coherence restorer. Re-locks reasoning when attention/logic collapses.  

You do **not** have to master all internals to benefit. If you can run a few checks, read one table, and paste one prompt, you can fix most production RAG issues.

---

## 1) The real structure of RAG (and why it fails)

```

raw docs (pdf/img/html)
→ ocr/parsing
→ chunking
→ embeddings
→ vector store (faiss/qdrant/chroma/elastic)
→ retriever (dense/sparse/hybrid/mmr)
→ prompt assembly (context windows)
→ llm reasoning (chain/agent/tools)

```

Typical stacked failure pattern:

1. **perception drift**: upstream stages quietly distort content (ocr noise, bad chunk boundaries, mismatched embeddings, empty/partial vector stores).  
2. **logic drift**: llm confidently “explains” the distorted view (hallucination with no visible error).

This is the “double hallucination” trap. The first illusion hides the second.

---

## 2) The WFGY recovery pipeline (10-minute overview)

| step | instrument | your question | what you do | what you learn |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **ΔS** | “is meaning tearing somewhere?” | measure semantic stress between question, retrieved context, and expected anchors | the **faulty segment/layer** |
| 2 | **λ_observe** | “which layer diverged?” | enable layered probes across retrieval, prompt, and reasoning | the **dominant failure family** |
| 3 | **E_resonance** | “can we re-lock coherence?” | apply stability modules (BBMC/BBPF/BBCR/BBAM) at the failing layer | the **repair action** |
| 4 | **ProblemMap** | “what page fixes this?” | open the matched doc (e.g., `retrieval-collapse.md`) | the **concrete fix recipe** |

> 90% of cases end after steps 1–3. You only go deeper when a fix requires a structural change (schema, retriever, index).

---

## 3) Quick triage (beginner path) — from symptom to fix

Copy/paste this checklist into your runbook. Execute top-down.

### A. fast metrics (run first)

1. **ΔS(question, retrieved_context)**  
   - compute cosine distance on sentence embeddings (unit-normalized).  
   - `ΔS = 1 − cosθ`.  
   - **trigger**: ΔS ≥ 0.50 (transitional risk), ≥ 0.60 (record & fix).

2. **ΔS(retrieved_context, ground_anchor)**  
   - ground anchor = title/section header/answer snippet you _expect_.  
   - **trigger**: same thresholds as above.

3. **coverage sanity**  
   - retrieved tokens vs. target section tokens: expect ≥ 0.7 overlap for direct QA.  
   - if < 0.5 → suspect chunking/boundary or retriever filtering.

### B. layer probes (λ_observe)

- **retrieval layer**: vary k ∈ {5, 10, 20}; plot ΔS vs. k.  
  - curve flat & high → vector store/index/embedding mismatch.  
  - curve improves sharply with k → retriever filtering too aggressive.
- **prompt layer**: reorder/rename sections; ΔS spikes when headers removed → prompt anchoring dependency (see `retrieval-traceability.md`).
- **reasoning layer**: ask “cite lines” vs. “explain why”  
  - cite fails, explain passes → perception drift (upstream)  
  - both fail similarly → logic collapse (see `logic-collapse.md`)

### C. pick the fix (ProblemMap jump table)

## 4) What the instruments mean (advanced but concise)

> You can use these without memorizing the math. Still, here’s the tight spec.

### 4.1 ΔS — semantic stress
- **definition**: `ΔS = 1 − cos( I , G )` where `I` = current embedding, `G` = ground/anchor.  
- **use**: probe _question↔context_ and _context↔anchor_.  
- **thresholds**:  
  - `< 0.40` stable  
  - `0.40–0.60` transitional (record if λ is divergent/recursive)  
  - `≥ 0.60` high risk (must act)

### 4.2 λ_observe — layered observability
- **states**: `→ convergent`, `← divergent`, `<> recursive`, `× chaotic`.  
- **use**: tag each step (retrieve, assemble, reason).  
- **rule of thumb**: if upstream λ is stable but downstream λ flips divergent → the fault is at the boundary between those layers.

### 4.3 E_resonance — coherence (re)locking
- rolling mean of residual magnitude `|B|` under BBMC (see below).  
- **use**: if E rises while ΔS stays high → apply BBCR (collapse→rebirth) and BBAM (attention modulation).

### 4.4 the four WFGY modules (repair operators)
- **BBMC**: _semantic residue minimization_ — drive `B = I − G + m·c²` toward 0 by respecifying anchors and context factors.  
- **BBPF**: _multi-path progression_ — explore alternate semantic paths and weight them by stability to avoid dead ends.  
- **BBCR**: _collapse–rebirth correction_ — detect failure (‖B‖ ≥ Bc) and rebuild a safe bridge node.  
- **BBAM**: _attention modulation_ — reduce variance in attention to prevent entropy melt.

---

## 5) Worked recoveries (copyable playbooks)

### Case A — “faiss looks fine, but answers are irrelevant”
- **observe**: ΔS(question, context) = 0.68; flat curve across k; citations miss expected section.  
- **interpret**: vector store populated but **embedding metric/normalization mismatch** or **index layer mix-up**.  
- **do**:
  1. ensure consistent normalization; verify cosine vs. inner product usage across write/read.  
  2. rebuild index with explicit metric flag; persist and reload once.  
  3. re-probe ΔS and λ on retrieval; expect ΔS ≤ 0.45 and convergent λ.  
- **docs**: `embedding-vs-semantic.md`, `retrieval-traceability.md`.

### Case B — “correct snippets, wrong reasoning”
- **observe**: ΔS(question, context) = 0.35 (good), but λ flips divergent at reasoning.  
- **interpret**: interpretation collapse; prompt assembly/role/constraints leak.  
- **do**:
  1. lock schema: system→task→constraints→citations→answer, forbidding re-order.  
  2. apply BBAM (variance clamp) and BBCR (bridge intermediate reasoning step).  
  3. require cite-then-explain; re-measure ΔS; aim for convergent λ.  
- **docs**: `retrieval-collapse.md`, `logic-collapse.md`.

### Case C — “long transcripts randomly capitalize / drift”
- **observe**: E_resonance rises with length; λ becomes recursive/chaotic.  
- **interpret**: entropy collapse under long context; chunk boundaries and OCR noise amplify.  
- **do**:
  1. semantic chunking (sentence/section aware), drop OCR confidence < threshold.  
  2. BBMC to align with section anchors; BBAM to stabilize attention.  
  3. verify ΔS across adjacent chunks; enforce ≤ 0.50 at joins.  
- **docs**: `entropy-collapse.md`, `hallucination.md`.

## 6) “Use the AI to fix your AI” — safe prompts you can paste

You can ask your assistant to **read TXT OS / WFGY files** and guide you. Use precise, bounded prompts:

```

read the WFGY TXT OS and ProblemMap files in this repo. extract the definitions and usage of ΔS, λ\_observe, E\_resonance, and the four modules (BBMC, BBPF, BBCR, BBAM). then, given this concrete failure:

* symptom: \[describe yours]
* logs: \[paste ΔS, λ\_observe probes if available]

tell me:

1. which layer is failing and why,
2. which ProblemMap page applies,
3. the minimal repair steps to lower ΔS below 0.50,
4. how to verify the fix with a reproducible test.

```

For formula-only assistance:

```

from TXT OS, extract the formulas and thresholds for ΔS, λ\_observe, and E\_resonance. show me how to compute ΔS(question, context) using cosine distance, what thresholds to use, and which WFGY module to apply if ΔS ≥ 0.60 with divergent λ at the reasoning layer.

````

---

## 7) Acceptance criteria and regression guardrails

- **retrieval sanity**: for targeted QA, ≥ 70% token overlap to expected section; ΔS(question, context) ≤ 0.45.  
- **reasoning stability**: λ remains convergent on three paraphrased queries; E_resonance does not trend upward.  
- **traceability**: run `retrieval-trace` and produce a two-column table (snippet id ↔ citation lines).  
- **repeatability**: same inputs over 5 seeds → answer embeddings cluster (low variance).

---

## 8) When to stop “tuning” and change the structure

Stop iterating prompts if **any** of the following holds:

- ΔS remains ≥ 0.60 after chunk/retrieval fixes.  
- lowering temperature only flattens style but not logic drift.  
- λ flips divergent as soon as you mix two sources.  
- E_resonance climbs in long chains.

Open the matching ProblemMap page and apply the structural fix (index rebuild, schema lock, bridge node, or agent boundary).

---

## 9) Minimal formulas (reference)

```txt
ΔS = 1 − cos(I, G)         # semantic stress
λ_observe ∈ {→, ←, <>, ×}  # convergent, divergent, recursive, chaotic
E_resonance = mean(|B|)    # rolling residual magnitude under BBMC

BBMC:  B = I − G + m·c²           # minimize ‖B‖
BBPF:  x_next = x + ΣV_i + ΣW_j·P_j
BBCR:  if ‖B‖ ≥ B_c → collapse(), bridge(), rebirth()
BBAM:  â_i = a_i · exp(−γ · std(a))
````

Thresholds: stable `<0.40`, transitional `0.40–0.60`, risk `≥0.60`.
Record nodes automatically when `ΔS > 0.60`, or `0.40–0.60` with `λ_observe ∈ {←, <>}`.

---

## 10) Final note

You are not “bad at RAG.” You were debugging from inside the maze.
WFGY gives you altitude, instruments, and a map.
Start with ΔS to *see* the break, use λ\_observe to *localize* it, apply the right module to *repair* it, and keep the ProblemMap open as your field manual.

When all tutorials contradict each other, this page is your single source of operational truth.
