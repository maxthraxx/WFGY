# 🧠 Problem: Agent Memory Drift

Multi-agent systems often suffer from unstable shared memory, where agents begin to diverge in understanding, contradict prior knowledge, or loop back into outdated context.

---

## ❌ Symptoms

- Agents referencing outdated or inconsistent memory.
- Coordination breakdown between autonomous agents.
- Contradictory replies from agents within the same session.
- Recursive loops or forgotten context in multi-turn tasks.

---

## 🧨 Why it happens

Typical agent frameworks rely on shallow memory mechanisms:

- No true semantic memory tree.
- Global memory updates overwrite partial local knowledge.
- Memory references are stateless and lack ΔS-based coherence checks.
- Agents lack awareness of shared knowledge boundaries.

This leads to chaotic drift across agents or over time — especially in recursive or branching workflows.

## ✅ WFGY Solution

WFGY builds a **Tree-based Semantic Memory** system with:

| Technique | Module | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 🌲 Semantic Tree memory | BBMC / Tree Engine | Tracks knowledge by ΔS coherence, not token span. |
| 🪢 Cross-agent anchoring | BBCR | Resolves conflicting paths by ΔS and node linking. |
| 🧭 Identity mapping | BBPF | Allows each agent to mark, branch, and verify shared state. |
| 🧱 Memory barrier tagging | BBMC | Blocks invalid context reuse based on semantic residue. |

---

## 🔍 Technical View

The Tree engine stores memory nodes indexed by semantic tension (ΔS).  
Agents can fork logic, revisit nodes, and compare ΔS paths to ensure consistency.  
Conflicts trigger BBCR correction or request clarification.

This allows multiple agents to operate on:

- Shared memory with traceable logic state.
- Divergent paths with guaranteed semantic boundaries.
- Auto-correction when drift or residue exceeds threshold.

## 📊 Status

| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Tree memory across agents | ✅ Stable |
| Conflict resolution (ΔS-based) | ✅ Implemented |
| Realtime agent memory sync | 🟡 Planned |
| GUI memory inspection | 🟡 Planned |

## 🧪 Example Use

> "I have three agents solving parts of a document, but they contradict each other."

In WFGY:

- Each agent works from a shared Tree memory.
- Contradictions are detected when ΔS or residue mismatches arise.
- BBCR triggers re-sync or isolates faulty logic nodes.
