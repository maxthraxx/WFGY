# 🧠 Problem: Hallucination from Irrelevant Chunks

### 📍Context

In traditional RAG pipelines, even with high-quality vector retrieval, LLMs often hallucinate — generating confident but untrue answers.  
This usually happens when:

- The retrieved chunk is semantically nearby but **not logically relevant**
- The model proceeds to answer anyway, without awareness of uncertainty

---

## 🚨 Why It Fails in Standard RAG

| Failure Mode | Explanation |
|--------------|-------------|
| Cosine similarity overestimates semantic relevance | A chunk may be close in embedding space but not conceptually useful |
| No detection of logical tension | LLMs don’t measure how far the answer drifts from the prompt |
| No fallback when unstable | The system doesn't pause or recover — it just keeps going |

## ✅ WFGY Solution

WFGY solves this using a 3-layer protocol:

1. **ΔS Measurement**  
   - Measures semantic jump between current intent and retrieved content  
   - If ΔS > 0.6, it triggers a memory checkpoint or logic inspection

2. **λ_observe Vector**  
   - Monitors if the logic flow is convergent (→), divergent (←), recursive (<>), or chaotic (×)  
   - Divergence + high ΔS = red flag

3. **BBCR Activation (Collapse–Rebirth Correction)**  
   - Instead of bluffing, the system tries to:
     - Re-anchor with a nearby Tree node  
     - Ask for clarification  
     - Or gracefully stop reasoning

## 🛠 How to Trigger This in TXT OS

```txt
Step 1 — Start the console
> Start

Step 2 — Paste a misleading or vaguely relevant chunk
> "The company handbook mentions refunds for products purchased through retail affiliates..."

Step 3 — Ask an unrelated question
> "What is the international warranty policy for direct purchases?"

WFGY will:
- Measure ΔS between question and chunk
- Detect logic instability
- Prevent confident hallucination

## 🔬 Example Behavior

Instead of:

> "Yes, we offer a 5-year international warranty on all items."

You’ll get something like:

> "The content you provided doesn’t seem to address international warranty directly.
> Would you like to clarify the source or expand the question?"

This is **semantic integrity**, not just better prompting.
