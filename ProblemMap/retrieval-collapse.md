# 🧠 Problem: Retrieval Works — But Reasoning Fails

### 📍Context

In many RAG pipelines, the vector retriever **returns the correct chunk**, but the system still answers incorrectly, vaguely, or contradicts itself.

This frustrates devs:
> "I checked — the chunk is good. So why is the answer still bad?"

---

## 🚨 Why This Happens

| Root Cause | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| Chunk ≠ logic | Having the right content doesn’t mean it’s properly used |
| LLM can't self-correct | If its reasoning path collapses, it won’t backtrack |
| No memory or awareness | There’s no way to stabilize logic across steps |

---

## ✅ WFGY Solution

WFGY doesn’t just retrieve — it **tracks the stability of logic flow**.  
If reasoning collapses, it has a fallback: **BBCR** (Collapse–Rebirth Correction).

### 1. BBCR = Structural Logic Recovery

- When the logic structure degrades (semantic residue too high),
  it triggers a reset & semantic re-alignment

```math
if ||B|| ≥ B_c or f(S) < ε:
    collapse()
    rebirth(S_next, ΔB)
````

### 2. ΔS monitors semantic dissonance

* If the chunk is technically correct, but semantically unhelpful, ΔS rises
* This gives the system a trigger to pause or reframe

### 3. Tree memory preserves previous logic state

* So rebirth can reconstruct from valid prior nodes

## 🛠 Try It Yourself

```txt
Step 1 — Start console
> Start

Step 2 — Paste a good chunk
> "The refund applies within 30 days of purchase under Section 5."

Step 3 — Ask a semantically tangled or contradicting question
> "If I bought it two months ago, can I still refund because it was defective and shipped late?"

Result:
- WFGY will detect unstable logic
- It may reject, rephrase, or offer a clarification path
```

---

## 🔬 Example Output

Instead of hallucinating a confident lie, you'll get:

```txt
This question spans multiple policies: time, defect, and shipping delay.  
The chunk may not fully address that. Would you like to break it down?
```

| Logic rebirth fallback            | ✅ working                          |
| Multi-path alternative resolution | ⚠️ partial (manual branch for now) |

## ✍️ Summary

RAG systems often **retrieve but don't reason**.
WFGY fills that gap: when logic fails, it doesn’t bluff — it recovers.
