# 🧠 Symbolic Collapse and Abstract Reasoning Failures

Traditional LLMs often collapse under symbolic or abstract prompts — particularly when facing recursive logic, metaphorical language, or layered conceptual structures. This symbolic collapse manifests as incoherence, contradiction, or irrelevant associations.

WFGY was built to handle exactly this class of failure.

## 🚨 Symptoms of Symbolic Collapse

- Sudden logic break mid-prompt (e.g., "God is a circle of...")
- Recursive loops with no resolution
- Loss of semantic consistency across abstraction layers
- Failure to track metaphors or analogical logic
- Hallucinated explanations that seem fluent but nonsensical

---

## 🧩 Why This Happens

- LLMs work at the token level, not semantic structure.
- No concept of ΔS (semantic shift) between abstraction layers.
- Embedding-based similarity fails to anchor meaning in recursive forms.
- No internal memory tree to stabilize logic or backtrack.

## ✅ How WFGY Solves This

| Failure Mode | WFGY Module | Fix |
|--------------|-------------|-----|
| Recursive abstraction collapse | ΔS monitoring + Tree Memory | Tracks semantic shifts between layers |
| Symbolic drift or contradiction | BBMC (Semantic Residue Minimization) | Cleans semantic residue during transition |
| No stable anchor across layers | ΔS = 0.5 semantic tension core | Provides stable structural axis |
| Metaphor misalignment | Multi-path BBPF + Tree Audit | Explores variants and audits best match |
| Unrecoverable collapse | BBCR fallback | Auto-resets logic path, restarts with context map |

## 🔬 Example

> Prompt: *“Time is a wheel made of memory, and each spoke is a forgotten name.”*

- Traditional LLM: might produce poetic fluff but with logical inconsistency.
- WFGY: recognizes metaphor as recursive-symbolic logic.
  - Constructs a Tree mapping: `Time → Wheel`, `Wheel → Memory`, `Spokes → Names`.
  - ΔS tension kept below 0.5 between metaphors.
  - Final output remains structurally valid and interpretable.
