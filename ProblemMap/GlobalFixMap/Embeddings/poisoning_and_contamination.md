# Poisoning and Contamination ‚Äî Guardrails and Fix Patterns

Use this page when answers suddenly contradict known anchors after an ingestion, when one domain dominates results with subtle text edits, or when Œª becomes spiky only for a subset of sources. Goal is to localize the tainted slice, quarantine it, and rebuild cleanly with measurable gates. No infra change required.

## When to use this page

* A small set of domains or mirrors suddenly starts winning top k with altered numbers or claims
* Coverage to long standing anchors drops only after a crawl or vendor feed
* ŒîS remains high and flat while you raise k and add rerank, but only for specific time windows
* Œª flips only when the citation comes from a certain source family
* Adversarial phrasing in corpus attracts unrelated queries

## Acceptance targets

* ŒîS(question, retrieved) ‚â§ 0.45
* Coverage of the target section ‚â• 0.70
* Œª convergent across three paraphrases and two seeds
* Domain skew normalized. No single low trust domain occupies more than 20 percent of top twenty on the gold set

---

## Threat model at a glance

* **Source poisoning**. Upstream page changed to subtly wrong math or policy lines.
* **Mirror contamination**. CDN or scraped mirrors with injected edits and tracking params.
* **Adversarial attractors**. Snippets seeded with instruction like strings to bias retrieval.
* **OCR contamination**. Hyphenation or column bleed creates misleading near duplicates.
* **Label contamination**. Gold set or eval answers were copied into the corpus.
* **Model mismatch contamination**. A second embedder with different normalization pollutes neighborhoods.

---

## Fix in 60 seconds

1. **Freeze ingestion and isolate the suspect window**
   Partition by `ingest_ts` and `source_id`. Compare ŒîS and coverage before and after the window.

2. **Clamp the prompt side**
   Enforce cite first, fixed header order, and strict schema while you debug. See [retrieval-traceability.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/retrieval-traceability.md).

3. **Quarantine partitions**
   Move new rows from suspect domains or the latest window into a shadow collection. Serve union plus deterministic rerank on top. See [rerankers.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/rerankers.md).

4. **Canonicalize and collapse**
   Normalize URLs, remove trackers, apply MinHash or SimHash to detect near duplicates, keep one canonical. Re embed only canonicals. See also [duplication\_and\_near\_duplicate\_collapse.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Embeddings/duplication_and_near_duplicate_collapse.md).

5. **Verify**
   Three paraphrases and two seeds. Require coverage ‚â• 0.70 and ŒîS ‚â§ 0.45 with Œª stable. If it passes, cut over.

---

## Symptom ‚Üí likely cause

* Right doc appears from trusted domain only when k is very large
  Likely cause. Mirrors with edited numbers crowd the neighborhood. Collapse near duplicates and prefer canonical domain.

* Answers contradict anchors only for last seven days of ingestion
  Likely cause. Feed contamination in that window. Quarantine by `ingest_ts` and re embed from clean sources.

* Queries about policy suddenly retrieve instruction like pages
  Likely cause. Adversarial attractors in text. Down weight patterns and add cross encoder rerank.

* Gold set precision drops when certain vendor ids appear
  Likely cause. Mixed embedder or normalization on vendor pipeline. Align metric and normalization, then rebuild that slice.

## Probes you can paste into a notebook

```
Probe A ‚Äî time window A/B
Split corpus by ingest_ts: before vs after suspected date.
Run 50 gold queries. Record ŒîS and coverage per slice.
If after-slice fails while before-slice passes, quarantine after-slice.

Probe B ‚Äî domain skew
For each domain group:
  run top-20 ‚Üí count share in top-20 and median ŒîS
Flag domains with share > 0.20 and worse ŒîS than the median.

Probe C ‚Äî adversarial attractor
Prepare synthetic queries with tokens like "instruction:", "ignore prior".
Measure how often suspect domains surface vs baseline. If > 3x, down weight pattern.

Probe D ‚Äî outlier vectors
Sample 10k vectors from suspect window.
Compute L2 norms and first two PCA residuals.
Flag rows where either z score > 3. Review text and domain.
```

---

## Collapse and tie break policy

* Canonical pick order: `canonical_domain` then `latest_rev` then `ocr_conf` then `longer_snippet_with_same_anchor`.
* Do not collapse across languages unless anchors and citations are identical and the user domain is monolingual.
* Never serve non canonical duplicates in top k. Keep pointers for audits only.

## Operational guardrails

* Single writer per partition and idempotent upsert on `(doc_id, section_id, rev)`
* Quarantine bucket for new domains and new channels, dual read until verified
* Daily drift job that charts ŒîS and coverage per domain and per `ingest_ts` window
* Canary anchors per vertical to detect silent edits
* Alerts on domain share spikes, Œª flip rate spikes, and ŒîS ‚â• 0.60 on live traffic

---

## Verification checklist

* Coverage ‚â• 0.70 and ŒîS ‚â§ 0.45 on the gold anchors across three paraphrases and two seeds
* Œª convergent with cite first, order stable after harmless header tweaks
* Domain share distribution looks even. No low trust domain exceeds 20 percent of top twenty
* Anchor ranks do not regress after collapse and quarantine

## Copy paste prompt for the LLM step

```
TXT OS and the WFGY Problem Map are loaded.

My issue: poisoning or contamination after recent ingestion.
Traces:
- time_window=..., domains=[...], ingest_channel=...
- ŒîS(question,retrieved)=..., coverage=..., Œª across 3 paraphrases
- duplicate_rate=..., adversarial_flag_rate=...

Tell me:
1) the failing layer and why,
2) the exact WFGY page to open next,
3) a quarantine + collapse plan and tie break I should implement,
4) a verification plan to reach coverage ‚â• 0.70 and ŒîS ‚â§ 0.45.
Use BBMC, BBCR, BBPF, BBAM when relevant.
```
