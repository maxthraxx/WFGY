Use this page when BM25 plus dense retrieval performs worse than either one alone, when top k flips between runs, or when hybrid recall feels random after an index rebuild. The goal is to put both retrievers on a common score space, then set stable weights, add a single deterministic reranker, and verify with ŒîS, coverage, and Œª.

## When to use this page

* BM25 finds the right doc yet dense misses, or the reverse
* Hybrid returns unstable order while single retrievers look stable
* Raising k helps only one side while the other side adds noise
* A client upgrade changes analyzers or tokenization and hybrid breaks

## Acceptance targets

* ŒîS(question, retrieved) ‚â§ 0.45
* Coverage of the target section ‚â• 0.70
* Œª remains convergent across three paraphrases and two seeds
* E\_resonance stays flat on long windows

## Core idea: put scores on the same ruler

Let `s_dense` be the dense similarity and `s_sparse` be the BM25 or keyword score. Raw values live in different spaces. Calibrate to a common space, then blend.

Common choices:

* Z score per retriever
  `z = (s ‚àí Œº) / œÉ` computed on the candidate pool for the current query

* Min max per retriever
  `m = (s ‚àí min) / (max ‚àí min)` on the candidate pool

* Platt style logistic calibration on a gold set
  Fit `p = sigmoid(a s + b)` for each retriever

After calibration, blend with a single weight:

`S = Œ± * z_dense + (1 ‚àí Œ±) * z_sparse`
Pick Œ± by grid search on a gold set, then lock it.

Always add a single deterministic reranker on the union of candidates. See [rerankers.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/rerankers.md).

---

## 60 second fix checklist

1. Normalize both score streams per query. Prefer z score on the union pool.
2. Build a union candidate set. Choose `k_dense` and `k_sparse` so that the union size before rerank is about 20 to 50.
3. Grid search Œ± in steps of 0.1 on your gold set. Pick Œ± that maximizes coverage at k and stabilizes Œª across seeds.
4. Add a single cross encoder reranker on top of the blended scores. Fix the seed.
5. Lock the header order and cite first to clamp Œª while you tune. See [retrieval-traceability.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/retrieval-traceability.md).
6. Verify the targets on three paraphrases and two seeds.

## Symptom to likely cause

* Hybrid worse than BM25 alone
  Likely cause. Dense scores unnormalized or wrong metric. Open [normalization\_and\_scaling.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Embeddings/normalization_and_scaling.md).

* Hybrid worse than dense alone
  Likely cause. Analyzer mismatch or stopword removal on one path. Open [pattern\_query\_parsing\_split.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/patterns/pattern_query_parsing_split.md).

* Order flips between runs
  Likely cause. Header reorder or union set not stable. Fix header order and use a stable tie break by `doc_id` then `section_id`. Open [retrieval-traceability.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/retrieval-traceability.md).

* Right doc appears only when k is very large
  Likely cause. Fragmented stores or per tenant splits without union. Open [vectorstore\_fragmentation.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Embeddings/vectorstore_fragmentation.md).

## Minimal calibration recipe

**Gold set**
Ten to fifty questions with known anchor sections. Keep per domain if you support many domains.

**Union recall**
Collect `k_dense` and `k_sparse` candidates. Form the union. Store raw scores and features.

**Per query normalization**
Compute z scores on the union for each retriever. Keep the statistics for audits.

**Blend and rerank**
Score with `S = Œ± * z_dense + (1 ‚àí Œ±) * z_sparse`.
Apply a single cross encoder rerank with a fixed seed.
Resolve ties by `doc_id` then `section_id`.

**Selection of Œ±**
Grid search Œ± from 0.0 to 1.0. Choose Œ± that maximizes coverage at k and keeps ŒîS ‚â§ 0.45 on the anchor.

**Freeze**
Record Œ±, k values, normalization method, reranker id, and seed in your contract.

## Copy paste probes

```
Probe A ‚Äî alpha sweep
For Œ± in {0.0..1.0 step 0.1}:
  compute coverage@k and median ŒîS on the gold set
Pick Œ± with highest coverage. Break ties by lower ŒîS and lower variance.

Probe B ‚Äî normalization sanity
Toggle {z, minmax, logistic} on the same union pool.
If results change wildly, per query statistics are unstable or candidate pools differ.

Probe C ‚Äî union size
Sweep k_dense and k_sparse so union size ‚àà [20, 50].
If coverage improves up to a point then drops, prune duplicates and near duplicates before rerank.

Probe D ‚Äî header clamp
Swap harmless header lines. If top k flips, clamp header order and apply cite first. Re test Œ± after clamp.
```

* ŒîS(question, retrieved) ‚â§ 0.45
* Œª convergent across two seeds and three paraphrases
* Top k overlap across seeds ‚â• 0.8 after rerank
* Stable results after harmless header reorders

## Copy paste prompt for the LLM step

```
TXT OS and WFGY Problem Map are loaded.

My issue: hybrid BM25 + dense is worse than single retrievers.
Traces:
- zscore_dense=..., zscore_sparse=..., alpha=...
- union_size=..., reranker=name, seed=...
- ŒîS(question,retrieved)=..., coverage=..., Œª across 3 paraphrases

Tell me:
1) the failing layer and why,
2) the exact WFGY page to open next,
3) a minimal calibration plan for hybrid weights and normalization,
4) a verification plan to reach coverage ‚â• 0.70 and ŒîS ‚â§ 0.45.
Use BBMC, BBCR, BBPF, BBAM when relevant.
