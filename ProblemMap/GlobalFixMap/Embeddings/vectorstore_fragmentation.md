A focused guide to detect and repair fragmented vector indexes. Use this when recall looks fine in pockets yet end answers miss the correct section or flip unpredictably. The fixes below are store agnostic and verified with ŒîS, Œª, and coverage targets.

## When to use this page

* Same query returns different top-k from different namespaces or shards
* Correct facts exist but only appear after raising k a lot
* High recall on a few documents while others are invisible
* Nightly re-embeds or per-tenant splits changed results without code changes

## Acceptance targets

* ŒîS(question, retrieved) ‚â§ 0.45
* Coverage of the target section ‚â• 0.70
* Œª remains convergent across 3 paraphrases and 2 seeds
* Top-k ordering stable after consolidation

---

## Symptom ‚Üí likely cause

* Good recall inside one namespace but misses across the corpus
  Likely cause: per-tenant or time-sliced indexes with no cross-merge fence

* Raising k surfaces the right doc only at large k values
  Likely cause: shard skew or HNSW params diverged across partitions

* A doc updated many times becomes ‚Äúhard to find‚Äù
  Likely cause: orphaned vectors from previous revisions not tombstoned

* Same corpus embedded by two models mixes in one store
  Likely cause: mixed dimension or normalization mismatch

* Hybrid BM25 + vector works worse than either alone
  Likely cause: analyzers differ per index, weights not calibrated

---

## Fix in 60 seconds

1. **Measure ŒîS and coverage**
   Run the query against each namespace or shard. Log ŒîS(question, retrieved) and coverage to the anchor section. If one partition is strong and others flat, you have fragmentation.

2. **Clamp Œª with a stable header**
   Apply citation-first schema and fixed header order to avoid prompt-side variance. See [retrieval-traceability.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/retrieval-traceability.md).

3. **Consolidate and re-rank**
   Merge results across partitions, then apply a single deterministic reranker. See [rerankers.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/rerankers.md).

4. **Verify**
   Coverage ‚â• 0.70 on three paraphrases, ŒîS ‚â§ 0.45, and top-k list stable across seeds.

---

## Root causes checklist

* Multiple namespaces per tenant without a union stage
* Mixed embedding models or mixed dimensions in one index
* Divergent metric or normalization per index
* HNSW or IVF params drift between shards
* Update pipeline creates new vectors but does not delete old ones
* TTL or retention policies silently evict sections
* Hybrid analyzer or tokenizer differs across stores
* Background jobs re-embed only a subset of the corpus

---

## Minimal repair playbook

**A) Contract your ingestion**

* Single writer. Idempotent writes with `doc_id`, `section_id`, `rev`, `index_hash`.
* Dedupe key = `sha256(normalized_text + source_id + section_id + rev)`.
* Enforce the same embedding model and normalization everywhere.

**B) Build a union retriever**

* Query all active partitions. Concatenate candidates with a common score scale.
* Apply one reranker with a fixed seed and top-k cap.
* Log partition id per hit for auditing.

**C) Tombstone and compact**

* On update, tombstone previous `(doc_id, section_id, rev)` vectors.
* Run a compaction job to drop orphaned vectors and re-index stats.

**D) Re-embed if metrics disagree**

* If ŒîS stays high and flat while you vary k, rebuild with a consistent metric.
* Use the checklist in [vectorstore-metrics-and-faiss-pitfalls.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/vectorstore-metrics-and-faiss-pitfalls.md).

## Copy-paste probes

**Three-paraphrase probe**

```
Ask the same question in 3 paraphrases.
For each partition p in {p1..pn}:
  retrieve top-20 ‚Üí compute ŒîS and coverage to the known anchor
Compare variance across partitions. Flag any partition with coverage < 0.50 or ŒîS > 0.60.
```

**Orphan sweep**

```
List vectors where (doc_id, section_id) exists with multiple rev but only latest rev is in the document store.
If count_old > 0, schedule tombstone + compaction.
```

**Hybrid calibration**

```
Hold out 50 queries with gold anchors.
Grid search weights Œ± ‚àà [0.1..0.9] for vector vs bm25.
Pick Œ± that maximizes coverage@k and stabilizes Œª across seeds.
```

## Escalation paths

* Still flat after consolidation and reranking
  Open: [embedding-vs-semantic.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/embedding-vs-semantic.md)

* Order unstable even with a single partition
  Open: [rerankers.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/rerankers.md)

* Suspected FAISS metric or index skew
  Open: [vectorstore-metrics-and-faiss-pitfalls.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/vectorstore-metrics-and-faiss-pitfalls.md)

* Payload lacks fields to audit ‚Äúwhy this snippet‚Äù
  Open: [data-contracts.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/data-contracts.md)

---

## Verification checklist

* Coverage ‚â• 0.70 on the gold anchor across 3 paraphrases
* ŒîS(question, retrieved) ‚â§ 0.45
* Œª does not flip when you reseed or reorder harmless headers
* Top-k overlap across partitions ‚â• 0.8 after consolidation

## Copy-paste prompt for the LLM step

```txt
You have TXT OS and WFGY Problem Map loaded.

My issue smells like vectorstore fragmentation.
Traces:
- partitions: [p1, p2, ...]
- ŒîS per partition: [...]
- coverage per partition: [...]
- model/metric/normalization: [...]

Tell me:
1) which layer is failing and why,
2) which WFGY page to open next,
3) the minimal structural fix to push ŒîS ‚â§ 0.45 and reach coverage ‚â• 0.70,
4) a short verification plan across 3 paraphrases and 2 seeds.
Use BBMC, BBPF, BBCR, BBAM as needed.
