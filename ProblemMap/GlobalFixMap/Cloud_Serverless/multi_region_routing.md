Keep latency low, fail over safely, and avoid split-brain state while your RAG, queues, and streams operate across regions. This page gives a compact playbook that you can paste into any load balancer or edge router policy.

## When to use this page

* Users in different geos see different answers or stale citations.
* Region outage triggers duplicate tool calls or replayed webhooks.
* Vector writes happen in one region while reads route to another.
* Canary in a single region is green yet the global cutover fails.
* DNS or anycast flips cut long-running streams.

## Open these first

* Boot order and deploy sequencing: [Bootstrap Ordering](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/bootstrap-ordering.md)
* Cross-service waits during rollout: [Deployment Deadlock](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/deployment-deadlock.md)
* First call failure after a new region comes online: [Pre-Deploy Collapse](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/predeploy-collapse.md)
* Retrieval correctness under routing changes: [RAG Architecture & Recovery](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/rag-architecture-and-recovery.md) ¬∑ [Retrieval Playbook](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/retrieval-playbook.md)
* Contract the payload and lock schemas: [Data Contracts](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/data-contracts.md)
* Reindex rules after topology change: [Reindex and Migration](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Chunking/reindex_migration.md)
* Live probes and rollback: [Live Monitoring for RAG](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/ops/live_monitoring_rag.md) ¬∑ [Debug Playbook](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/ops/debug_playbook.md)

## Acceptance targets

* p95 latency improves for local users or stays within ten percent of single-region baseline.
* No increase in 5xx at failover or failback.
* Idempotency dedupe rate ‚â• 99.9 percent on all write paths during failover windows.
* For RAG: ŒîS(question, retrieved) drift ‚â§ 0.03 across regions, Œª remains convergent on two seeds.
* Vector index hash identical per region before routing users. `INDEX_HASH` matches on probes.

## Fix in 60 seconds

1. **Pin by header, not only DNS**
   Add `X-Region-Pin: {region}` and `X-Release: {rev}`. Edge selects nearest healthy region unless a pin is present. Synthetic probes always include the pin.

2. **Fence writes with idempotency keys**
   Compute `sha256(source_id + revision + index_hash + partition)` and drop duplicates in the KV. Keep the fence for failover\_window plus 24 hours.

3. **Replicate index and blobs before traffic**
   Block user routing until `INDEX_HASH` equals across regions and blob manifests match.

4. **Graceful streams**
   Sticky route long-lived connections. Drain the old region for N seconds. Do not cut an active stream at the router.

5. **Health with contract checks**
   Health is green only if `schema_rev`, `model_tag`, `index_hash` and secret versions match. Pure 200 is not sufficient.

---

## Routing patterns that work

* **Active-active with sticky reads**
  Reads route to nearest healthy region and stay sticky for the session. Writes go to the region that owns the partition. Use a queue to replicate to others.

* **Active-passive for stateful writers**
  All writes go to primary. Secondary serves read-only. Promote only after index and blob parity plus a clean queue tail.

* **Geo-partitioned stores**
  Partition by tenant or namespace. Keep retrieval within the same partition and region. Cross-partition requests require a join step with explicit contracts.

---

## Typical breakpoints ‚Üí exact fix

* **Wrong snippet in far region despite high similarity**
  Index or metric differs. Compare `INDEX_HASH` and analyzer settings. Rebuild and verify a small gold set before routing traffic.
  Open: [Retrieval Playbook](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/retrieval-playbook.md), [Embedding ‚â† Semantic](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/embedding-vs-semantic.md)

* **Duplicate webhooks during regional flip**
  Retry plus DNS cutover replays the same event. Use the idempotency fence and a replay TTL beyond the failover window.
  Open: [Bootstrap Ordering](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/bootstrap-ordering.md)

* **Split-brain memory or tool cache**
  Agent memory writes with no version pins cross regions. Namespace by `tenant`, `mem_rev`, and `region`.
  Open: [Multi-Agent Problems](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/Multi-Agent_Problems.md)

* **Streams cut at failover**
  Router does not support drain. Pin streams with a cookie or header, then change the default path only for new connections.
  Open: [Timeouts and Streaming Limits](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Cloud_Serverless/timeouts_streaming_body_limits.md)

* **Cost spikes after enabling global anycast**
  Cold starts increase in remote regions. Raise min instances or provisioned concurrency selectively on hot routes.

## Minimal recipes you can copy

### A) Region pinning contract

```txt
Request headers
- X-Region-Pin: us-east-1 | eu-west-1 | ap-southeast-1
- X-Release: r2025-08-27
- X-Index-Hash: a1b2c3
- X-Schema-Rev: sc-12
Router rule
- If pin present and region healthy ‚Üí route pinned
- Else pick nearest healthy with matching {schema_rev, index_hash, model_tag}
- Sticky cookie for streaming connections
```

### B) Failover gate

```txt
Gate conditions before user traffic
- INDEX_HASH equal across regions
- Blob manifest parity
- Health probes return {schema_rev, model_tag, secrets_rev} exact match
- Synthetic RAG probes: ŒîS drift ‚â§ 0.03 on k=10 questions
- Dedupe KV warm and reachable in both regions
```

### C) Vector replication note

```txt
Replication
- Prefer periodic rebuild from source texts per region
- If log shipping: checkpoint offsets, verify analyzer parity
- After topology change: run gold-set eval and lock reranker order
Refs: retrieval-playbook, reindex-migration
```

---

## Observability you must add

* Split metrics by `region`, `release_id`, and `revision`.
* Health includes `schema_rev`, `index_hash`, `model_tag`, `secrets_rev`.
* Dedupe hit rate, queue age, replay counts per region.
* ŒîS and Œª on a fixed probe set, per region.
* Stream drain success count at flips.

## Verification

* Probe set stable within acceptance targets.
* No duplicate side effects in the failover window.
* p95 improves for local users or remains flat.
* Queue age does not spike at promotion.

## When to escalate

* Persistent ŒîS drift across regions after rebuild. Re-embed with the same analyzer and metric, then re-run the gold set.
* Dedupe misses during outage replay. Increase KV TTL and ensure consistent hashing across regions.
* Health green yet errors rise. Add contract checks to the probe and block routing when versions disagree.
