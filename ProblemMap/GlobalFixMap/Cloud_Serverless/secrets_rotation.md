A practical runbook to rotate API keys, signing secrets, and JWKS without breaking RAG pipelines or agent flows. Implements dual-accept windows, kid tagging, cache fences, and rollback so rotations are invisible to users and stable under load.

## When to use this page

* Incoming 401/403 spikes during deploys or scale-out.
* Webhook verification fails after a provider rotates its signing secret.
* Mixed keys across regions or functions after a partial rollout.
* Long-lived workers holding stale secrets in memory.
* SOC or policy requires periodic rotation with audit.

## Acceptance targets

* Zero user-visible errors during the rotation window. No p95 increase.
* 0 auth failures in synthetic probes across all regions and paths.
* Old secret fully revoked within the planned TTL and verified by logs.
* For RAG: no citation loss and ŒîS(question, retrieved) ‚â§ 0.45 on the probe set after rotation.

## The two-keys-live pattern

Always rotate with two keys in play: the current key used for signing and a next key accepted for verification. Tag every credential with a key id so validation does not guess.

**Key rules**

1. Always include a stable kid on every token or signature.
2. Verify against `active_kids = {current, next}`. Sign with `current` only.
3. Flip in one step by promoting `next ‚Üí current` when error rate is flat.
4. Revoke the old key after caches drain and long jobs finish.

**Minimal KV schema**

```json
{
  "secrets_epoch": "2025-08-27T12:00:00Z",
  "active": { "kid": "k_2025_08a", "secret_ref": "sm://wfgyp/prod/k_2025_08a" },
  "next":   { "kid": "k_2025_09a", "secret_ref": "sm://wfgyp/prod/k_2025_09a" },
  "accept_kids": ["k_2025_08a", "k_2025_09a"],
  "revoke_after_s": 259200, 
  "notes": "roll weekly; accept_kids must be length 2 max"
}
```

**HTTP header examples**

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token_with_kid>
X-Key-Id: k_2025_08a
```

For JOSE tokens, put `kid` in the header. For HMAC signatures, include `X-Key-Id`.

---

## Zero-downtime rotation timeline

**T-24h**

* Create `next` in your secret manager.
* Update `accept_kids = {current, next}`.
* Push config to all regions and functions. Do not sign with next yet.

**T-0**

* Start signing with `current`. Keep accepting both.
* Warm all regions. Run probes for 10 minutes.
* Flip signer to `next` when probes are flat.

**T+1h to T+72h**

* Keep accepting both while streams drain and long jobs finish.
* Watch auth errors by `kid`.
* After TTL, remove `current` from `accept_kids` and revoke it in the secret manager.

**Rollback**

* If errors rise after the flip, restore signer to the previous `current`. Leave accept set unchanged.

---

## Long-lived workers and caches

* Serverless functions may cache secrets in memory. Read secrets on each invocation or attach an `If-Modified-Since` check with a short TTL.
* Edge and CDN caches can pin config. Add `secrets_epoch` to cache keys or use a config version header.
* For JWKS, publish both public keys and set short cache-control. Clients must refresh on `kid` miss.

---

## Webhook secret rotation

* Accept two signatures. Verify first with `kid` if provided. If not, attempt both only inside the rotation window.
* Return a 2xx with a deprecation header to prompt senders to upgrade keys.
* Log the `kid` used for every valid request and alert when legacy `kid` drops below a threshold.

---

## Third-party provider keys

* Inject provider API keys from a secret manager at request time. Never bake into build artifacts.
* Keep a per-provider `accept_kids` and test with small traffic shadow before promoting.
* If a provider rotates without `kid`, schedule a short freeze window and fall back to a secondary provider if available.

---

## Observability you must add

* Counters of 401/403 by `route`, `region`, and `kid`.
* Ratio of requests verified by current vs next.
* Time to first successful verification with `next` in each region.
* Number of long-lived executions running past the flip time.
* JWKS cache hit and miss per `kid`.

---

## CI policy to prevent unsafe rotations

Fail the build when any of the following is true:

1. `accept_kids` does not contain exactly two values.
2. `next.secret_ref` is missing or unreadable.
3. `revoke_after_s` is not set or exceeds the policy maximum.
4. Routes that verify webhooks are not wired to read `X-Key-Id` or JOSE `kid`.

---

## Copy-paste verifier for serverless functions

```txt
On cold start:
1. Fetch LIMITS.json and SECRETS.json.
2. Pin {accept_kids, active.kid} to memory with TTL = 60s.
3. Expose verify(req):
   - extract kid from header or token header.
   - if kid in accept_kids ‚Üí choose secret by kid and verify.
   - else refresh secrets and retry once, then fail.

On each request:
- If now - secrets_cache_ts > 60s ‚Üí refresh in the background.
- Emit metric: {route, region, kid_used, verified=true|false}.
```

---

## Typical failure patterns ‚Üí exact fix

* **Only one key accepted during rollout**
  Old workers keep signing while new verifiers reject. Add dual-accept and reduce cache TTL.
  Open: [Deployment Deadlock](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/deployment-deadlock.md)

* **Webhook fails because sender changed secret before receivers**
  Allow two secrets, prefer `kid` when present. Add retry with jitter and short backoff.
  Open: [Bootstrap Ordering](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/bootstrap-ordering.md)

* **Large headers during rotation**
  Multiple auth headers overflow 8‚Äì16 KB. Collapse to one `X-Key-Id` and one signature.
  Open: [Prompt Injection](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/prompt-injection.md)

* **Silent partial revocation**
  Some regions still accept old key due to pinned caches. Force refresh and invalidate edge caches by `secrets_epoch`.
  Open: [Edge Cache Invalidation](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Cloud_Serverless/edge_cache_invalidation.md)

---

## Verification checklist

* Blue-green probe calls succeed with both keys before the flip.
* After flip, 95 percent of traffic verifies with `next` within 10 minutes.
* After revoke, zero successful verifications with old `kid`.
* RAG probe answers remain unchanged and pass ŒîS ‚â§ 0.45.
