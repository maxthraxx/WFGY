# Chunking ‚Äî Global Fix Map
Find and fix the silent breaks at document boundaries.  
You use this when sections look fine but retrieved snippets cut mid idea, tables split, or anchors vanish.

## What this page is
- A quick route to correct chunk sizes, fences, and anchors.
- Structural rules to stop boundary drift without touching models.
- Checks you can measure and repeat.

## When to use
- Top-k looks plausible but citations point to the wrong half of a section.
- Tables or code blocks are split across chunks.
- Headers disappear or merge with the next paragraph.
- Long answers smear topics across two sources.
- Recall is high but precision is noisy around joins.

## Fix in 60 seconds
1) **Probe ŒîS at joins**  
   - Compute ŒîS across adjacent chunks A‚ÜîB for the same section title.  
   - Trigger: ŒîS ‚â• 0.50 at the join or ŒîS spikes when you remove the header.
2) **Add Œª_observe markers**  
   - Ask cite-then-explain. If cite fails and explain passes, boundary drift is the cause.
3) **Patch the structure**  
   - Keep headers and section ids inside each chunk.  
   - Do not split code fences, tables, math.  
   - Cap plain-text chunks by semantic units, not hard token length.  
   - Add `section_id`, `page_no`, `char_span` to every snippet.  
   - For very long sections store sub-section anchors.

## Copy-paste prompt
```

I uploaded TXT OS and the WFGY ProblemMap files.

My chunking bug:

* symptom: \[brief]
* traces: \[ŒîS at several joins], \[examples of split tables or code], \[Œª states]

Tell me:

1. which boundary rule is violated and why,
2. which fix pages to open in this repo,
3. minimal steps to push ŒîS(join) ‚â§ 0.45 and keep Œª convergent,
4. how to verify with a snippet ‚Üî citation table.
   Use BBMC for anchor alignment. If logic still flips, apply BBCR bridge.

```

## Minimal checklist
- One header per chunk. Keep the header text in the chunk body.  
- Never cut a table, code block, or list mid item.  
- Prefer sentence or paragraph aware splitters.  
- Store stable ids: `source_id`, `section_id`, `sub_id` if any.  
- Keep cross-refs like figure or table captions with the referenced block.  
- Add back-pressure: if a chunk would cut a fence, expand to include the full unit.

## Acceptance targets
- ŒîS(question, retrieved) ‚â§ 0.45 on three paraphrases.  
- ŒîS at adjacent joins ‚â§ 0.50.  
- Cite-then-answer passes consistently.  
- Œª stays convergent when you reorder non-semantic headers.  
- Retrieval coverage to the target section ‚â• 0.70.
