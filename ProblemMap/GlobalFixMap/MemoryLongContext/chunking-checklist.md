Long-context retrieval often fails not at the level of whole documents but at the **joins between chunks**.  
This checklist enforces stable, reproducible chunking so citations line up and entropy does not melt across boundaries.

---

## When to use
- Citations drift by a few lines between runs.  
- Long transcripts lose alignment after OCR or parsing.  
- Model answers cover the right fact but cite the wrong block.  
- ŒîS spikes exactly at chunk joins.  
- Different agents disagree on chunk IDs.  

---

## Core acceptance targets
- Each join ŒîS ‚â§ **0.50**.  
- Overall ŒîS(question, retrieved) ‚â§ **0.45**.  
- Coverage ‚â• **0.70** of intended section.  
- Œª remains convergent across 3 paraphrases.  
- Each chunk has immutable `chunk_id`, `start_line`, `end_line`.  

---

## Checklist for stable chunking

- **Deterministic boundaries**  
  Split on semantic units (sections, paragraphs, headings). Never by raw token count alone.  

- **Overlap fence**  
  Add 10‚Äì15% overlap at joins. Enforce consistent overlap across every run.  

- **Immutable IDs**  
  Generate `chunk_id = sha256(doc_id + start_line + end_line)`. Store and reuse.  

- **Audit trail**  
  Store `{chunk_id, start_line, end_line, source_url, tokens}` for every chunk.  

- **Normalization**  
  Apply Unicode NFC, collapse whitespace, unify casing.  

- **Confidence gating**  
  Drop OCR or parsing lines with low confidence before chunking.  

---

## Fix in 60 seconds
1. Re-chunk corpus using semantic units.  
2. Apply overlap fence and store immutable chunk IDs.  
3. Run ŒîS probes at joins. If ŒîS > 0.50, re-check boundaries.  
4. Store all chunk metadata in trace logs.  
5. Require cite-then-answer. Reject any orphan chunk references.

## Copy-paste prompt

```

You have TXT OS and the WFGY Problem Map.

Task: enforce stable chunking.

Protocol:

1. Verify each snippet has {chunk\_id, start\_line, end\_line, section\_id, source\_url}.
2. Reject orphans: if citation lacks chunk\_id, stop and request fix.
3. Require cite-then-answer.
4. Probe ŒîS across joins, keep ‚â§ 0.50.
5. Report ŒîS(question,retrieved), ŒîS(joins), and Œª state.

```

---

## Common failure signals
- Answers cite correct fact but wrong block ‚Üí chunk IDs not stable.  
- ŒîS spikes exactly at joins ‚Üí overlap missing.  
- OCR transcripts break alignment ‚Üí normalization skipped.  
- Multi-agent systems cite different chunk IDs ‚Üí contract drift.
