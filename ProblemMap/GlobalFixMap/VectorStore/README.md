# Vector Store ‚Äî Global Fix Map
Make your store consistent, populated, and explainable.  
Use this when FAISS/Qdrant/Chroma/Elastic ‚Äúworks‚Äù but retrieval still feels wrong or inconsistent.

## What this page is
- A concise checklist to validate population, metrics, and read/write symmetry.
- Structural fixes for empty/fragmented stores and stale or misconfigured indices.
- Steps you can verify with ŒîS curves and citation tables.

## When to use
- Answers look unrelated even though the store is ‚Äúfull‚Äù.
- First queries after boot return nothing or random snippets.
- Some facts never appear although indexed.
- Hybrid retrieval becomes worse than a single retriever.
- After a deploy, results change wildly with the same query.

## Fix in 60 seconds
1) **Probe ŒîS**
   - Chart `ŒîS(question, retrieved)` vs `k ‚àà {5,10,20}`.  
   - Flat-high curve ‚Üí index/metric/normalization mismatch or partial population.

2) **Population sanity**
   - Count vectors per collection and compare to docs/chunks.  
   - Ensure no silent failures in batch ingestion or concurrency during build.

3) **Read/write symmetry**
   - Same embedding model id on write and read.  
   - Same distance metric (cosine vs inner product) and dimensionality.  
   - If cosine, confirm unit normalization on both sides.

4) **Index configuration**
   - FAISS: confirm index type (IVF/HNSW/PQ), nprobe/efSearch, and that the trained index file is persisted + reloaded.  
   - Qdrant/Chroma/Elastic: verify exact metric flags, shard/replica consistency, warm-up finished.

5) **Rebuild once with explicit metadata**
   - Persist: model_id, dim, metric, normalizer, tokenizer, build_params.  
   - After rebuild, re-probe ŒîS and store acceptance plots with traceability.

6) **Rank after recall**
   - If recall is good but ordering is noisy, add a light reranker from the playbook.  
   - Keep citation schema to audit the change.

## Copy-paste prompt
```

I uploaded TXT OS and the WFGY ProblemMap pages.

My vector store bug:

* symptom: \[brief]
* ŒîS traces: vs k = {...}, current ŒîS(question, retrieved)=..., anchor ŒîS=...
* write: model=\[...], metric=\[cosine|ip], dim=\[...], norm=\[on|off], index=\[IVF|HNSW|PQ], params=\[...]
* read:  model=\[...], metric=\[...], dim=\[...], norm=\[...]
* population: vectors=\[count], docs=\[count], ingestion logs=\[summary]

Tell me:

1. what mismatch or population issue explains it,
2. which exact WFGY pages to open,
3. the minimal rebuild/rescore steps to push ŒîS ‚â§ 0.45,
4. how to verify with ŒîS-vs-k, precision/recall, and a snippet‚Üîcitation table.
   Use BBMC alignment if anchors are stable; add a reranker only after recall is fixed.

```

## Minimal checklist
- One embedding model per collection or store `model_id` with each vector.  
- Fix metric/normalization once and persist with the index.  
- Keep text pre-processing identical on write and read.  
- Validate `dim` and dtype; no truncation or hidden casts.  
- Log and compare vector count = sum(chunk count).  
- Disallow writes during index training; warm up after boot.  
- Snapshot + restore indexes atomically; avoid mixed versions.  
- Run fragmentation pattern if some facts never retrieve.

## Acceptance targets
- ŒîS(question, retrieved) ‚â§ 0.45 across paraphrases.  
- ŒîS-vs-k descends then flattens, not flat-high.  
- Precision/recall meet your eval sheet; top-k is explainable by traceability.  
- Œª stays convergent at retrieval after rebuild.  
- Same results across restarts with deterministic warm-up.
