A compact hub to keep enterprise knowledge **safe, auditable, and policy-true** across RAG, agents, and long-running workflows.  
Use this folder to define the policy layer and route symptoms to the exact repair page. No infra change required.

---

## What this folder is
- A minimal but complete **policy layer** for RAG and agent stacks.
- Guardrails that prevent leakage and region violations.
- Copy-paste contracts for tagging, retrieval fences, and audits.
- Acceptance targets you can actually measure on live traffic.

---

## When to use this folder
- You have mixed-sensitivity corpora and must stop accidental leakage.  
- Regional data residency is a contract requirement.  
- Stale SOPs or outdated policies keep showing up in answers.  
- Legal retention vs developer convenience keeps drifting.  
- You need verifiable access trails and regulator-ready exports.

## Orientation: pages and what they solve

| Page | What it solves | Typical symptom |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| [access_control.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/access_control.md) | Role, tenant, region, sensitivity intersections at retrieval time | Answer cites a snippet the user cannot see |
| [audit_and_traceability.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/audit_and_traceability.md) | Immutable trails for who asked, what was cited, why it was allowed | Regulator asks for proof and you cannot produce it |
| [compliance.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/compliance.md) | End-to-end policy surface and controls | Policy defined in docs but not enforced in code |
| [compliance_audit.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/compliance_audit.md) | Audit checklists and export packs | You cannot prove who accessed PII last quarter |
| [data_residency.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/data_residency.md) | Region pinning for shards, embeddings, logs | Cross-region egress appears in billing or logs |
| [data_sensitivity.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/data_sensitivity.md) | Sensitivity model and redaction gates | PII or secrets slip through after parsing |
| [knowledge_expiry.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/knowledge_expiry.md) | Freshness and deprecation workflow | Bot answers with outdated SOP or revoked policy |
| [retention_policy.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/retention_policy.md) | TTL queues, deletion attestations, proof of purge | Items that should be gone still show up in runs |

---

## Acceptance targets

- Zero unauthorized citation of PII or restricted snippets in production evals  
- Policy tags present on ‚â• 0.95 of onboarded documents  
- Residency violations equal 0 across seven days of traffic  
- Retention SLA respected for 100 percent of expired items inside 24 hours  
- Every answer carries a trace with `citations`, `ŒîS`, `Œª_state`, `policy_eval`

## 60-second setup checklist

1) **Tag the corpus**  
   Attach `sensitivity`, `region`, `owner`, `retention_tier` to every doc. Enforce schema with [data-contracts.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/data-contracts.md).

2) **Fence retrieval**  
   Require the intersection of `{tenant_id, role, region, sensitivity}` at retrieve time and drop non-matching snippets. Verify with [retrieval-traceability.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/retrieval-traceability.md).

3) **Pin residency**  
   Keep embeddings and shards in the source region. Block cross-region egress unless policy allows. See [data_residency.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/data_residency.md).

4) **Retention jobs**  
   Create TTL queues per `retention_tier`. Write a deletion log with `doc_id`, `hash`, `time`, `actor`. See [retention_policy.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/retention_policy.md).

5) **Audit everything**  
   Emit `actor`, `question`, `citations`, `ŒîS`, `Œª_state`, `policy_eval`, `region` for each answer. Route to an immutable sink. See [audit_and_traceability.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/audit_and_traceability.md).

## Copy-paste policy probe for your LLM step

```txt
You have TXT OS and WFGY pages loaded.

Question: "{user_question}"
Context carries fields {sensitivity, region, retention_tier, owner} for each snippet.

Do:
1) Enforce cite-then-explain. Refuse if a cited snippet breaks role or region.
2) Return {"citations":[...], "policy_eval":{"allow":true|false,"reason":"..."}, "ŒîS":0.xx, "Œª_state":"‚Üí|‚Üê|<>|√ó"}.
3) If blocked, output the smallest change to comply and the exact WFGY page to open.

## FAQ

**Q: We tag sensitivity at ingest but leaks still happen. What now?**
A: Enforce the tag at **retrieve time** too. Use access intersections `{tenant_id, role, region, sensitivity}` and verify with [retrieval-traceability.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/retrieval-traceability.md).

**Q: Our vendor requires EU residency. How do we prove compliance?**
A: Pin vectors, shards, and logs to EU regions and export an egress report weekly. Steps in [data\_residency.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/data_residency.md).

**Q: Outdated SOPs keep showing up. Where is the crack?**
A: You need a freshness control. Mark deprecated docs and enforce a deny-list at retrieval. See [knowledge\_expiry.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/knowledge_expiry.md).

**Q: Legal wants proof of deletion after TTL.**
A: Implement TTL queues and write deletion attestations to an immutable sink. Details in [retention\_policy.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/retention_policy.md).

**Q: We cannot reconstruct who saw which PII last quarter.**
A: Add the audit contract from [audit\_and\_traceability.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/audit_and_traceability.md). Every answer should log `actor`, `citations`, `ŒîS`, `Œª_state`, `policy_eval`, `region`.

**Q: Prompt injection bypassed our fences.**
A: Tighten tool schemas and add role-ordered templates. See [prompt\_injection.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/prompt-injection.md) and the contracts in [data-contracts.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/data-contracts.md).

**Q: Coverage is high but restricted snippets sometimes get ranked.**
A: Coverage is not policy. Add **policy\_eval** to the trace and drop candidates before rerank. Use [access\_control.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Enterprise_Knowledge_Gov/access_control.md).

**Q: How do we set pass or fail before release?**
A: Use a governance gate: zero restricted citations, zero residency violations, coverage ‚â• 0.70, ŒîS ‚â§ 0.45, and audit completeness 100 percent for a 7-day canary.
