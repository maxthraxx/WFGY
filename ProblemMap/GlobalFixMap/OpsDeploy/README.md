# Ops & Deploy ‚Äî Global Fix Map
Ship RAG safely. Prevent first-call crashes, boot loops, silent index mismatches, and deadlocks.

## What this page is
- A compact preflight and post-deploy checklist
- Concrete guards for cold starts, indexes, secrets, and rollbacks
- How to verify with ŒîS and Œª_observe before opening traffic

## When to use
- New environment or fresh cluster
- First call after deploy crashes or returns empty results
- CI passes yet production deadlocks the retriever or vectorstore
- Rollback flips facts, cache or state becomes inconsistent
- Spiky traffic after release melts attention and logic quality

## Common failure patterns
- **Bootstrap fence missing** services start before their dependencies are ready
- **Metric skew** vectorstore written with cosine but read with inner product
- **Cold index** process boots with empty or partial index due to path or permission
- **Secret drift** env var present in CI, missing in prod
- **Version split** retriever and writer built from different commit hashes
- **Idempotency gap** rebuild attempts create multiple indices or stale shards
- **Traffic spike** no warm cache, first N requests time out, model collapses
- **Health check blindness** green probes do not cover retrieval path end to end

---

## Fix in 60 seconds
1) **Add a semantic boot fence**
   - Block traffic until `{secrets_ok, index_ok, metric_ok}` are all true
   - Emit a single ‚ÄúREADY‚Äù event with commit hash and index stats

2) **Make index build idempotent**
   - Absolute data path, explicit metric flag, checksum on the source corpus
   - Persist and reload once, forbid concurrent writers

3) **Pin retrieval metric at read and write**
   - Log metric type into index metadata and assert on load
   - Fail fast if mismatch is detected

4) **Warm the cache before opening**
   - Run a smoke set of 10 queries and store the snippets in the cache layer
   - Record ŒîS(question, retrieved) and require ‚â§ 0.45 median

5) **Gate secrets and configs**
   - Verify tokens, endpoints, and collection names are non empty and reachable
   - Print a redacted config table in startup logs

6) **Prepare safe rollback**
   - Blue-green or canary, read-only window on flip, copy index handles not paths
   - Keep a one step ‚Äúrebind to old index‚Äù switch

7) **Observe the first minute**
   - Live chart of errors per route, p50 and p95 latency, ŒîS median and tail
   - Alert if ŒîS tail exceeds 0.60 or Œª flips divergent at reasoning

Goal
Preflight and post-deploy validation for a RAG service. Block traffic until the system is provably ready.

Preflight

1. Print a Config Table with {commit, build\_time, model\_id, retriever\_metric, index\_path, collection\_name}.
2. Verify secrets: call the vectorstore admin API and return {reachable: true|false}.
3. Check index: {exists, size, doc\_count, embedding\_dim, metric\_type}. Fail if metric\_type != retriever\_metric.
4. Health probes

   * run 10 smoke queries against the index
   * for each: compute ŒîS(question, retrieved) and record Œª\_observe at retrieval and reasoning
   * require median ŒîS ‚â§ 0.45 and no divergent Œª at retrieval
5. Warmup

   * store the top snippets for those 10 queries into cache
   * print warm cache keys

Post-deploy

1. Open traffic gradually: 10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100% if ŒîS tail ‚â§ 0.60 and error rate < 1%.
2. If collapse or spike:

   * apply BBCR bridge at reasoning
   * reduce concurrency, retry with warmed snippets
3. Emit a READY line
   {ready\:true, commit, index:{doc\_count, metric}, smoke:{median\_ŒîS, tail\_ŒîS}, Œª:"‚Üí"}

Output

* Config Table
* Index Summary
* Smoke Table with ŒîS and Œª states
* READY or BLOCKED with reasons

```

## Minimal checklist
- Boot fence blocks traffic until secrets, index, and metric checks pass  
- Idempotent index build and reload with explicit metric and checksum  
- Retrieval metric pinned and asserted at read and write  
- Smoke queries warmed and ŒîS median ‚â§ 0.45 before go live  
- Canary or blue-green with fast index rebind for rollback  
- Live ŒîS and Œª telemetry on first minute after open

## Acceptance targets
- Deterministic warm start with READY event in a single pass  
- Vectorstore non empty, metric consistent, and cached smoke snippets present  
- ŒîS(question, retrieved) median ‚â§ **0.45**, 95th ‚â§ **0.60** during ramp  
- Œª stays **convergent** at retrieval and reasoning on three paraphrases  
- No first-call crash, no deadlock at index or retriever
