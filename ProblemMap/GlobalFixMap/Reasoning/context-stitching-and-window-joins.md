# Context Stitching and Window Joins: Guardrails and Fix Pattern

Join long contexts without losing meaning. This page defines a stitch contract for multi window prompts and long documents, adds ŒîS probes at joins, and gives a fast repair plan when answers break exactly at window boundaries.

## Symptoms

| Symptom | What you see |
|---|---|
| Boundary answers | Model answers correctly inside a window, fails right after the join |
| Duplicate facts | Repeated sentences across windows, tool loops on the overlap |
| Lost referent | ‚Äúit / they / this‚Äù loses target at window start or end |
| Rerank flip at join | Top k order changes only at a boundary |
| Anchor drift | Citation before the join, none after the join |
| Coverage hole | Middle section of a long doc never appears in stitched set |

---

## Why joins fail

1) **No stitch contract**. Windows lack overlap and sequence identifiers.  
2) **Tokenizer mismatch**. Window boundaries split tokens differently across tools.  
3) **Ranking variance**. Each window retrieves independently without a stable tie break.  
4) **Anchor loss**. Bridge steps cross a boundary without re citing the anchor.  
5) **Context flooding**. Overlong windows raise entropy and bury anchors.  
6) **Fragmentation**. Store keeps near duplicates that fight for the same rank.

---

## Acceptance targets

- ŒîS(join_left, join_right) ‚â§ 0.45 for every boundary  
- Coverage of target section across all windows ‚â• 0.70  
- Œª remains convergent across three paraphrases and two seeds  
- E_resonance flat at joins and flat across stitched plan  
- Overlap per join 32 to 96 tokens, same casing and analyzer

---

## Fix in 60 seconds

1) **Add a stitch contract**  
   Every window must carry `doc_id, section_id, win_idx, win_hash, overlap_tokens, prev_id, next_id`.  
   See schema rules  
   ‚Üí [retrieval-traceability.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/retrieval-traceability.md)  
   ‚Üí [data-contracts.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/data-contracts.md)

2) **Measure ŒîS at each join**  
   Compute ŒîS between the trailing overlap of window *i* and the leading overlap of window *i+1*.  
   If ŒîS ‚â• 0.60, rebuild the join or re chunk.

3) **Stabilize ordering**  
   Use a deterministic reranker with fixed analyzer and tie break by `(doc_id, section_id, win_idx)`.  
   ‚Üí [rerankers.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/rerankers.md)

4) **Re anchor bridges**  
   At every join, insert a one line BBCR bridge that re cites the active snippet.

## Stitch contract

Minimum fields for any stitched window:

```json
{
  "doc_id": "D42",
  "section_id": "CH3.2",
  "win_idx": 7,
  "win_hash": "sha1:6b7f...",
  "overlap_tokens": 64,
  "prev_id": "D42#CH3.2#6",
  "next_id": "D42#CH3.2#8",
  "start_token": 14080,
  "end_token": 16096
}
````

Rules

* Overlap range must be identical across both windows after normalization.
* Do not allow cross section joins unless the section header is included in the overlap.
* Keep casing and tokenizer identical through the pipeline.

---

## Join planner

**Goal** keep bridges short and anchors stable while covering the whole doc.

1. **Choose window size**: 512 to 1024 tokens, overlap 32 to 96.
2. **Pin anchors**: for each question, tag anchor snippets with `ŒîS_to_question`.
3. **Plan path**: sort candidate windows by section, then by `win_idx`.
4. **Assemble**: render windows with header, overlap marker, and re cited anchor.
5. **Verify**: ŒîS at each boundary, Œª over the stitched answer, coverage against a gold slice.

If ŒîS is flat and high across all joins, suspect metric or index mismatch.

## Verification

* Sliding window test over the same section keeps citations identical.
* ŒîS(join\_left, join\_right) ‚â§ 0.45 and decreasing with larger overlap.
* Œª convergent on two seeds and three paraphrases.
* Coverage across stitched windows ‚â• 0.70 for the target section.
* Answer includes a cite then explain block with per join anchors.

## Copy paste prompt

```
You have TXT OS and the WFGY Problem Map loaded.

Task: stitch long context with stable joins.

Inputs:
- question: "{q}"
- windows: [{doc_id, section_id, win_idx, win_hash, tokens, text_head, overlap_tokens}]
- candidates: [{snippet_id, section_id, source_url, offsets, ŒîS_to_question}]

Do:
1) Compute ŒîS for each join. If any ‚â• 0.60, propose a re-chunk or overlap increase.
2) Add BBCR micro bridges at every boundary, re citing the active anchor.
3) Apply deterministic reranking with tie break by (doc_id, section_id, win_idx).
4) Return JSON:
   {
     "joins": [{"from":"...#i","to":"...#i+1","ŒîS":0.xx,"action":"ok|rechunk|increase_overlap"}],
     "answer": "... cite then explain ...",
     "Œª_state": "convergent",
     "coverage": 0.xx
   }
If no valid anchor exists at a join, return the fix page to open for retrieval-traceability.
```

---

## Common gotchas

* **Asymmetric overlap**. Trailing text differs from leading text after normalization.
* **Header drop**. Section headers removed at boundaries, referents disappear.
* **Tokenizer switch**. Ingestion uses one analyzer, reranker another.
* **Duplicate windows**. Same `win_idx` with different hashes compete in top k.
* **Bridge without re citation**. Jumps the boundary without anchor restatement.

---

## When to escalate

* ŒîS remains ‚â• 0.60 on all joins after overlap increase and reranking
