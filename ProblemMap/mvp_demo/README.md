# MVP Demo — WFGY ProblemMap

This folder contains *demo-only* Python code for the MVP phase of WFGY modules.  
It is **not production-ready**, but can run directly without dependencies beyond Python 3.8+.

## Structure
```

mvp\_demo/
├── layers/        # Layer modules demo
├── operators/     # Formula/operator demo
├── instruments/   # Tool demo
├── patterns/      # Usage patterns / scenarios
├── jump\_table/    # Simple jump/branch example
├── main.py        # Entry point that calls everything

````

## How to run
```bash
cd mvp_demo
python main.py
````

## Notes

* All code is **self-contained** and should run without errors.
* The intent is to illustrate how these modules could be structured, not to provide full functionality.
