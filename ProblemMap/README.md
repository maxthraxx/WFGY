# 🧠 WFGY Problem Map

This folder maps real-world reasoning and alignment failures — and how WFGY solves them.

Each problem is grouped by domain (RAG, multi-agent logic, philosophical abstraction, attention collapse, etc), with a clear mapping to WFGY modules and solutions.

> ✅ Some entries are already live with full breakdowns.  
> 🔧 Others are planned — we’ve identified the failures and are actively building solutions.

## 🧩 What’s in each problem page?

Each `.md` page includes:

- What’s going wrong (failure symptoms)
- Why it happens in typical LLM/RAG stacks
- How WFGY solves it — module-by-module
- Implementation status (✅ live / 🔧 in-progress / 🛠 planned)

> Browse [RAG_Problems.md](./RAG_Problems.md) to explore real issues like hallucination, drift, embedding misalignment — and how WFGY fixes them.
