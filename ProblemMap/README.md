# 🧠 WFGY Problem → Module → Solution Map (v0.1 · RAG Focus)

This page maps common reasoning and retrieval failures — especially in RAG pipelines — to their corresponding WFGY solutions.

WFGY is not a retrieval system.  
It is a semantic reasoning engine that augments, replaces, or corrects what existing RAG stacks often fail to do.

## 🔍 RAG-Related Failures and WFGY Solutions

| Problem | WFGY Solution | Module(s) | Status | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 🔸 Hallucination from irrelevant chunks | Semantic Boundary + ΔS monitoring | BBCR, BBMC | ✅ | System detects when input has low semantic match and activates fallback |
| 🔸 Retrieval returns correct chunk but reasoning fails | Multi-path semantic logic | BBPF | ✅ | WFGY builds stable reasoning paths even from vague sources |
| 🔸 Long question-answer chains drift off-topic | Semantic Tree memory + ΔS threshold | BBMC, Tree | ✅ | Semantic jump tracking records nodes, avoids context collapse |
| 🔸 System "bluffs" when it doesn’t know | Knowledge boundary map | BBCR | ✅ | WFGY detects unstable ΔS + λ_observe and requests clarification |
| 🔸 Embedding similarity ≠ semantic meaning | Residual Minimization | BBMC | ✅ | Matches logic anchor, not just vector cosine |
| 🔸 Retrieval success but interpretation collapse | Collapse–Rebirth protocol | BBCR | ✅ | Logic collapse auto-detected, triggers correction path |
| 🔸 No traceability across user sessions | External semantic memory tree | Tree engine | ⚠️ | Manual export/import for now; persistent store upcoming |
| 🔸 Debugging why RAG failed = painful | Manual tree audit | All modules | ✅ | Tree view shows where logic drifted or ΔS spiked |
| 🔸 Chunk ingestion pipeline | — | — | 🛠 | Not yet implemented; user pastes chunk into node manually |
| 🔸 No LangChain compatibility yet | — | — | 🛠 | Adapter planned; WFGY can serve as pre/post-processing layer |

## ✅ What you can do now

Even without any retriever, WFGY lets you:

- Paste content manually and reason on it
- Test hallucination safety via ΔS / λ_observe
- Record and inspect logic paths via Tree
- Detect unknown zones before the model bluffs

This means: WFGY is a **RAG failsafe layer**, even without retrieval working.

## 🧪 Example Use: "My PDF bot keeps hallucinating answers"

> → Paste the question and chunk into WFGY  
> → If ΔS is too high, it’ll pause or route to BBCR  
> → You can inspect the logic trace and see where it went off  
> → You’ll know if it’s the chunk’s fault — or the reasoning engine

## 🔧 Next Steps (Roadmap)

- [ ] Vector chunking → semantic node auto-mapping  
- [ ] LangChain & LlamaIndex adapters  
- [ ] Auto-summarization of Tree for memory replay  
- [ ] GUI explorer for Tree inspection  
- [ ] Integration with BlotBlotBlot / Persona agents

For now, if you're a RAG user tired of hallucinations, TXT OS + WFGY gives you a stable, inspectable core to reason with.

Feel free to open an issue if your failure case isn’t listed.
