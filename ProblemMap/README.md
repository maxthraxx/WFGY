# 🧠 WFGY Problem → Module → Solution Map

This folder maps real-world AI reasoning failures — especially in RAG and agent systems — to the WFGY modules that solve them.

Each problem includes a dedicated `.md` page with symptoms, root causes, module breakdowns, and implementation status.

## 📌 Navigation: Solved AI Failure Modes

| Problem Domain | Description | Link |
|----------------|-------------|------|
| 🔹 Hallucination & Chunk Drift | Wrong or irrelevant content from retrieved context | [hallucination.md](./hallucination.md) |
| 🔹 Interpretation Collapse | Chunk is correct, but model can’t reason properly | [interpretation-collapse.md](./interpretation-collapse.md) |
| 🔹 Long Reasoning Chains | Model drifts across multi-step chains | [long-chain-drift.md](./long-chain-drift.md) |
| 🔹 Bluffing / Overconfidence | Model pretends to know what it doesn’t | [knowledge-boundary.md](./knowledge-boundary.md) |
| 🔹 Semantic ≠ Embedding | Cosine similarity doesn’t mean logical match | [embedding-gap.md](./embedding-gap.md) |
| 🔹 Logic Collapse + Recovery | System runs into a dead end without reset | [collapse-rebirth.md](./collapse-rebirth.md) |
| 🔹 Memory Breaks Across Sessions | No continuity or traceability over time | [memory-break.md](./memory-break.md) |
| 🔹 Debugging is a Black Box | Can’t trace how/why a model failed | [tree-audit.md](./tree-audit.md) |
| 🔹 Entropy Collapse | Attention melts, content loses coherence | [entropy-collapse.md](./entropy-collapse.md) |
| 🔹 Creative Freeze | Model becomes boring, literal, unimaginative | [creative-freeze.md](./creative-freeze.md) |
| 🔹 Symbolic Collapse | Model fails under abstract/logical structure | [symbolic-collapse.md](./symbolic-collapse.md) |
| 🔹 Philosophical Recursion | Self-referential logic or paradoxes crash model | [philosophical-recursion.md](./philosophical-recursion.md) |
| 🔹 Multi-Agent Chaos | Agents overwrite each other, lose memory/role | [multi-agent-chaos.md](./multi-agent-chaos.md) |

## ⚒️ How These Docs Work

Each `.md` problem file includes:

- 🧩 Problem description + failure symptoms  
- 🔍 Why current systems fail  
- 🧠 WFGY module(s) solving it  
- 🛠️ Implementation status  
- 🧪 Live examples
