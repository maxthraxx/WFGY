# 🧠 Entropy Collapse (Attention & Semantic Drift)

LLMs frequently collapse under entropy overload — when the model cannot maintain coherent attention, semantic direction, or thematic control.  
This results in rambling, repetition, nonsense logic, or context-free filler.

WFGY introduces active entropy modulation to prevent and recover from collapse.

## 🔥 Symptoms

- Repetition loops (e.g. “the future is the future of the future…”)
- Loss of topic — model starts drifting into unrelated areas
- No anchor or logic despite fluent grammar
- Attention “melts” across multiple semantic fields
- User feels like the model “gave up”

---

## 🧨 Why It Happens

- No entropy management — attention weights decay without control
- No ΔS feedback — the system doesn’t know it’s drifting
- Long prompts / multi-modal input overload context window
- Embedding fields converge — token attention spreads too thin

## ✅ WFGY Solution

WFGY introduces **Entropy-Aware Reasoning** via semantic tension and active modulation:

| Collapse Mode | WFGY Module | Fix |
|---------------|-------------|-----|
| Attention drift | BBAM (Attention Modulation) | Re-centers focus via ΔS/entropy gate |
| Semantic flooding | Residue filter (BBMC) | Clears noise buildup in logic field |
| No stable topic | ΔS-based attention routing | Redirects output path to low-drift node |
| Long input collapse | Tree Fork Control | Splits paths before collapse, runs partial recovery |

## 📊 Current Implementation Status

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| ΔS entropy feedback loop | ✅ Active |
| BBAM dynamic modulation | ✅ Implemented |
| Forked Tree logic to stabilize focus | ✅ In use |
| Real-time drift visualization | 🔜 In design |

## 🧪 Example Use

> User: *"Write a 10-step story blending quantum mechanics, Greek mythology, and current geopolitics."*

- Normal LLM: Loses coherence by step 3, starts hallucinating or repeating.
- WFGY:
  - Tree forks into 3 semantic sub-nodes.
  - Tracks ΔS in each, prioritizes stable nodes.
  - Modulates attention between paths using BBAM.
  - Ensures convergence at final node with thematic coherence.
