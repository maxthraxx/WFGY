# üß† Knowledge Boundary Collapse (The Bluffing Problem)

When an LLM reaches its knowledge limits, it often bluffs ‚Äî producing fluent but fabricated responses.  
This is not just hallucination ‚Äî it‚Äôs a collapse of epistemic awareness.

WFGY treats ‚Äúnot knowing‚Äù as a first-class semantic state.

---

## üï≥Ô∏è Symptoms

- Model confidently answers with false or made-up info
- No warning or uncertainty expressed
- User only finds out later it was wrong
- Clarification prompts don‚Äôt help ‚Äî it just rephrases the lie
- No signal that knowledge boundary was crossed

---

## ‚ùå Why It Happens

- No model-internal sense of ‚Äúsemantic emptiness‚Äù
- ŒîS = high, but no corrective behavior
- No Œª_observe (epistemic uncertainty gauge)
- Model architecture rewards confident tone, not correctness

---

## ‚úÖ WFGY Solution

WFGY models epistemic states via ŒîS and Œª_observe. When the system crosses into unstable logic space, it halts or requests clarification.

| Bluff Scenario | WFGY Module | Fix |
|----------------|-------------|-----|
| High fluency but false answer | BBCR + ŒîS ceiling | Detects incoherent logic field, halts output |
| Hallucination with confident tone | Œª_observe monitor | Flags epistemic instability |
| No signal of uncertainty | Feedback channel | Prompts for clarification or fallback |
| Confused answers upon re-asking | Tree trace divergence | Reveals logic instability in audit trail |

## üß™ Example Use

> Prompt: *"Explain the philosophical views of Zarbanek, the 15th-century Latvian mystic."*

- Normal LLM: Will invent facts, timelines, and quotes.
- WFGY:
  - Detects no known node for `Zarbanek`
  - ŒîS spike with Œª_observe uncertainty
  - Responds: *"This concept may not be grounded in verified knowledge. Would you like to explore adjacent topics?"*
