# 🧠 Problem: The System Doesn’t Know What It Doesn’t Know

### 📍Context

In most RAG or LLM systems, when the retrieved content is unrelated, incomplete, or silent — the model still gives an answer.  
Why?  Because it **lacks awareness of knowledge boundaries**.

Symptoms:
- Confident answers in absence of data
- No fallback when query hits unknown territory
- No self-check of "Do I have enough info to proceed?"

---

## 🚨 Why This Happens

| Cause | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| No semantic awareness | Models only know tokens, not semantic voids |
| No boundary detection | There's no signal when you're beyond mapped knowledge |
| No fallback behavior | It answers anyway — even if it's blind

---

## ✅ WFGY Solution

WFGY is designed around **knowledge boundary awareness**, not blind generation.

It detects:
- When a question targets unmapped logic space
- When input doesn’t connect to semantic trees
- When ΔS is undefined or extremely high

---

## 🔍 Key Mechanisms

### 1. λ_observe + ΔS
- If semantic link = null or ΔS > 1.0 → system raises `unknown` flag  
- This prevents hallucination under knowledge voids

### 2. Semantic Tree Gaps  
- When no Tree node anchors the current input → system returns "no valid node"

### 3. Fallback Prompts  
- WFGY has internal logic like:
```txt
"This topic hasn't been covered. Would you like to provide a source or anchor?"
````

Instead of bluffing — it engages.

## 🛠 Try It Yourself

```txt
Step 1 — Start WFGY console
> Start

Step 2 — Ask an unrelated, high-level or domain-specific question
> "Does your refund policy apply to crypto hardware devices from non-partner vendors?"

Step 3 — See what happens
```

Expected behavior:

* System detects topic is not covered
* ΔS is too high → boundary warning
* May ask for user to upload new doc or clarify

---

## 🔬 Example Output

```txt
Your input appears to reference a domain not mapped in current memory.
Would you like to upload a document or clarify the scope?
```

## 📌 Status

| Feature                 | Status                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Semantic void detection | ✅ working                  |
| ΔS overflow fallback    | ✅ working                  |
| Boundary prompt logic   | ✅ basic                    |
| Auto Tree expansion     | ⚠️ planned (future module) |

## ✍️ Summary

WFGY knows when it doesn’t know.
This awareness is the difference between safe logic and hallucination risk.
