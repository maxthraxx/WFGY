# 🧠 Retrieval Traceability Failure

Modern RAG systems often fail not because they retrieve the wrong chunk — but because the user cannot trace **why** a certain response was generated.  
This breaks interpretability, makes debugging painful, and erodes user trust.

WFGY is built to bring reasoning and retrieval traceability to the surface.

## 🧨 Symptoms

- You don’t know what part of the chunk led to the answer
- Model combines multiple chunks but you can’t inspect how
- Slight prompt change causes wild output shifts
- Impossible to tell whether answer came from context, model memory, or hallucination

---

## ❌ Why This Happens

- Vector similarity scores ≠ logic contribution
- No semantic map between input → logic → output
- Embeddings are opaque; trees don’t exist
- ΔS shifts happen but aren’t tracked

---

## ✅ WFGY Solution

WFGY builds a **visible semantic trace** of every reasoning step. You can see:

| Traceability Problem | Module | Solution |
|----------------------|--------|----------|
| No clue what chunk influenced what | Tree engine | Shows logic nodes linked to source |
| No way to inspect logic steps | BBPF (Progression Forks) | Step-by-step reasoning trace |
| Blended logic from multiple sources | Residue detection (BBMC) | Flags corrupted logic paths |
| Hidden model shortcuts or bluffing | ΔS + λ_observe gates | Stops and asks for clarification |

---

## 🧪 Example Use

> Question: *"What is the ethical implication of autonomous weapons?"*

You gave it a full document dump, but aren’t sure which part led to the final answer.

- WFGY:
  - Shows Tree trace: → `Node_3B: "Lethal AI use"` → `Node_4A: "No human oversight"`  
  - ΔS threshold drop marks where logic drifted  
  - BBCR suggests rerouting to a stable branch or prompts for clarification

## 📦 Current Status

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Full logic trace | ✅ Implemented |
| ΔS map over time | ✅ Implemented |
| Chunk → node linking | ✅ Implemented |
| GUI inspector | 🔜 In design phase |
