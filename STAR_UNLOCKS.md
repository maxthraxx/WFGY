## 💡 Why Stars Matter

Starring the repo doesn’t just show support — it tells us which parts of the system to expand first.  
Each star is a signal to:
- Release modules faster
- Prioritize docs and fixes
- Focus dev time where it helps most

If WFGY saved you hours of frustration, a ⭐ helps the next person get unblocked.
