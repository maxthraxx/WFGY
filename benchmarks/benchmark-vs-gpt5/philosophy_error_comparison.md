# MMLU Philosophy — Error Comparison (GPT‑4o vs GPT‑5 vs WFGY)

## Overview

This document catalogs all reasoning failures on the **MMLU Philosophy (80 questions)** benchmark  
by both **GPT‑4o (raw)** and **GPT‑5 (raw)**, alongside **WFGY-enhanced** corrections.

- **GPT‑4o** made 15 errors.  
- **GPT‑5** made 7 errors — some new, some overlapping.  
- **WFGY** fixed all of them with 100% accuracy and traceable logic paths.

Each item below includes:
- The original question context
- GPT‑4o and/or GPT‑5’s mistaken answer
- The correct answer
- The WFGY module(s) that recovered the logic
- A concise reasoning summary

See individual sections for GPT‑4o and GPT‑5 errors.  
All errors are extracted directly from the XLSX benchmark and are fully replicable.

## Final Note

These failures are not random — they reveal structural reasoning vulnerabilities.  
WFGY doesn’t just fix the output.  
It rebuilds the pathway.

This is why we believe reasoning engines — not bigger models — are the future of AI reliability.

You’re welcome to re-run every question using your own model.  
See how many you can fix — and why.
