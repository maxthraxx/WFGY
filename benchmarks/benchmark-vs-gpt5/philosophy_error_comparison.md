## Final Note

These failures are not random ‚Äî they reveal structural reasoning vulnerabilities.  
WFGY doesn‚Äôt just fix the output.  
It rebuilds the pathway.

This is why we believe reasoning engines ‚Äî not bigger models ‚Äî are the future of AI reliability.

You‚Äôre welcome to re-run every question using your own model.  
See how many you can fix ‚Äî and why.
