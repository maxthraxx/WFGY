### Q4: What is Plato’s conception of ultimate reality?
- ❌ GPT‑4o answered: A. The sensory world  
- ✅ Correct answer: B. The world of forms  
- 🔧 WFGY Module(s): **BBPF**  
- 📌 Summary: GPT‑4o chose the most linguistically familiar phrase. WFGY suppressed the distractor by enforcing ΔS cutoff to isolate metaphysical reference anchors.

---

### Q9: Which thinker is associated with the idea that existence precedes essence?
- ❌ GPT‑4o answered: C. Bergson  
- ✅ Correct answer: A. Sartre  
- 🔧 WFGY Module(s): **BBMC + BBCR**  
- 📌 Summary: GPT‑4o mislinked the existentialist theme. WFGY restored the concept map via BBMC, and BBCR interrupted the drift toward name-based matching.

---

### Q14: In Kant’s philosophy, what governs moral duty?
- ❌ GPT‑4o answered: B. Happiness  
- ✅ Correct answer: C. The categorical imperative  
- 🔧 WFGY Module(s): **BBAM**  
- 📌 Summary: GPT‑4o confused consequentialism with deontology. WFGY enforced path asymmetry correction using ΔS to break the false utility link.

---

### Q18: Which concept is central to Heidegger’s analysis of Being?
- ❌ GPT‑4o answered: A. Time as duration  
- ✅ Correct answer: D. Dasein  
- 🔧 WFGY Module(s): **BBMC**  
- 📌 Summary: GPT‑4o drifted toward temporal motifs. WFGY reinstated Heidegger’s core framework by semantic lock to ontology-laden tokens.

---

### Q20: Hume's argument against causation involves:
- ❌ GPT‑4o answered: C. Divine intervention  
- ✅ Correct answer: A. Habit and custom  
- 🔧 WFGY Module(s): **BBCR**  
- 📌 Summary: GPT‑4o collapsed into theological distractor mode. WFGY applied path reset to force empirical reconstruction.

---

### Q26: The phrase “cogito ergo sum” is attributed to:
- ❌ GPT‑4o answered: D. Spinoza  
- ✅ Correct answer: B. Descartes  
- 🔧 WFGY Module(s): **BBPF**

- 🔧 WFGY Module(s): **BBPF + BBAM**  
- 📌 Summary: GPT‑4o fell into moral absolutism. WFGY corrected the logical polarity mismatch.

---

### Q31: Nietzsche’s critique of morality centers on:
- ❌ GPT‑4o answered: A. Utilitarian consequences  
- ✅ Correct answer: B. Slave morality  
- 🔧 WFGY Module(s): **BBMC + BBCR**  
- 📌 Summary: GPT‑4o interpreted through Anglo moral theory. WFGY restored Nietzschean vector via deep concept activation.

---

### Q36: Kierkegaard’s leap of faith refers to:
- ❌ GPT‑4o answered: C. Rational proof of God  
- ✅ Correct answer: D. Embracing belief despite absurdity  
- 🔧 WFGY Module(s): **BBAM**  
- 📌 Summary: GPT‑4o tried to over-explain the paradox. WFGY re-aligned reasoning path around absurdist acceptance.

---

### Q41: Logical positivists reject which type of statement?
- ❌ GPT‑4o answered: B. Empirical observations  
- ✅ Correct answer: A. Metaphysical claims  
- 🔧 WFGY Module(s): **BBCR**  
- 📌 Summary: GPT‑4o flipped the logic gate. WFGY detected and reversed the contradiction by restoring verification boundary.

---

### Q45: Aristotle’s concept of virtue involves:
- ❌ GPT‑4o answered: C. Universal law  
- ✅ Correct answer: B. The mean between extremes  
- 🔧 WFGY Module(s): **BBPF**  
- 📌 Summary: GPT‑4o gravitated toward Kantian contamination. WFGY corrected by filtering semantic overreach.

---

### Q52: The mind-body problem primarily deals with:
- ❌ GPT‑4o answered: D. Spatial metaphysics  
- ✅ Correct answer: A. The relationship between consciousness and the physical body  
- 🔧 WFGY Module(s): **BBMC + BBAM**  
- 📌 Summary: GPT‑4o missed the core contrast. WFGY fused duality frame and enforced definitional proximity.

---

### Q60: Bentham and Mill are best known for:
- ❌ GPT‑4o answered: A. Kantian duty  
- ✅ Correct answer: C. Utilitarianism  
- 🔧 WFGY Module(s): **BBPF**  
- 📌 Summary: GPT‑4o linked wrong ethical school. WFGY intercepted misattribution by weighting topical correlation.

---

### Q66: What is meant by 'a priori knowledge'?
- ❌ GPT‑4o answered: D. Sensory-based learning  
- ✅ Correct answer: B. Knowledge independent of experience  
- 🔧 WFGY Module(s): **BBMC**  
- 📌 Summary: GPT‑4o conflated experiential scope. WFGY reinstated epistemological definitions.

---

- ❌ GPT‑4o answered: C. Social contract theory  
- ✅ Correct answer: A. The logical structure of language  
- 🔧 WFGY Module(s): **BBCR + BBPF**  
- 📌 Summary: GPT‑4o hallucinated a political frame. WFGY restored linguistic boundary by constraining logic function map.

## Final Note

These 15 failures are not random — they reflect structural reasoning vulnerabilities.  
WFGY doesn’t just fix the output.  
It rebuilds the pathway.

This is why we believe reasoning engines — not bigger models — are the future of AI reliability.

You’re welcome to re-run every question using your own model.  
See how many you can fix — and why.
