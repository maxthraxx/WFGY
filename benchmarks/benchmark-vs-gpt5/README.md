## Introduction

This benchmark is built using **GPT‚Äë4o + WFGY reasoning engine**,  
executed through either **PDF-based testing pipelines** or the **TXT OS interface** ‚Äî  
both powered by the same symbolic structure system known as **WFGY (Ëê¨Ê≥ïÊ≠∏‰∏ÄÂºïÊìé)**.

We do not rely on LLM tricks, prompting heuristics, or fine-tuning.  
We enforce logic.  
We enforce traceability.

## Why Only MMLU Philosophy?

We deliberately chose the **80-question MMLU Philosophy subset** as the first public benchmark for three reasons:

1. **It‚Äôs the most semantically fragile domain**:  
   - Questions involve long-range inference, abstract categories, and fine-grained distinctions.
   - GPT models frequently hallucinate or break logic paths here ‚Äî even under normal prompting.

2. **It tests reasoning, not memory**:  
   - No factual recall needed.
   - Only coherent semantic alignment and logic flow.

3. **It‚Äôs a strong indicator of system structure**:  
   - If a system can survive philosophy cleanly, it can survive anything downstream (law, policy, meta-ethics, etc.)

All questions were answered manually using WFGY-enhanced flows.  
Anyone can **replicate the entire test** by downloading the XLSX files, clearing the answer column,  
and re-running the inputs through **any AI model + WFGY engine**.

> Full replication takes ~1 hour.

## Benchmark Result: GPT‚Äë4o (raw) vs GPT‚Äë4o + WFGY

| Model              | Accuracy  | Mistakes | Errors Recovered | Traceable Reasoning |
|--------------------|-----------|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| GPT‚Äë4o (raw)       | 81.25%    | 15 / 80  | ‚Äî                | ‚úò None              |
| GPT‚Äë4o + WFGY      | 100.00%   | 0 / 80   | ‚úî 15 / 15        | ‚úî Every step        |
| GPT‚Äë5 (TBD)        | ???       | ???      | ???              | ???                 |

> GPT‚Äë4o got 15 questions wrong.  
> WFGY fixed every single one ‚Äî with full semantic traceability per answer.

## Why Could We Fix What GPT‚Äë4o Missed?

Because WFGY is **not a prompt trick**, but a reasoning engine built on symbolic convergence and collapse prevention.

Each failure by GPT‚Äë4o fell into one of the following error categories:

- **BBPF** ‚Äî false positive via semantic distractors
- **BBCR** ‚Äî collapse in reasoning loop, reset mid-chain
- **BBMC** ‚Äî missing concept recall, overconfident misfire
- **BBAM** ‚Äî asymmetry in logic path, ambiguous choices unresolved

WFGY applies targeted constraints via ŒîS control, entropy modulation, and path symmetry enforcement ‚Äî  
as defined in the ([WanFaGuiYi paper](https://zenodo.org/records/15630969))  and symbolic engine specs.

## What Happens When GPT‚Äë5 Arrives?

We will:

- Run the **same 80 questions**, same format, no tricks
- Post raw GPT‚Äë5 results within hours of public release
- Publish a full comparison update on this page
- Release a **Zenodo-snapshotted benchmark** with DOI, to permanently record all result states

If GPT‚Äë5 performs better ‚Äî we welcome it.  
If it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äî we‚Äôll explain why.

## Reproducibility Promise

- No closed weights, no internal hacks  
- Every file is downloadable  
- Every test can be re-run  
- Every answer has a reason

> This isn‚Äôt a leaderboard.  
> It‚Äôs a reasoning audit.

And WFGY is the auditor.
