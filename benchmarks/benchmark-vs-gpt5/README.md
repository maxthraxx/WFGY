# üß† GPT‚Äë5 vs WFGY ‚Äî The Logic Duel Begins

> "GPT‚Äë5 is the future?  
> Then we‚Äôll benchmark the future ‚Äî with the tools we already have."

üõ†Ô∏è This page is under construction.  
üìå **Bookmark it now** ‚Äî when GPT‚Äë5 is released, we‚Äôll post the full results of our public showdown.

And yes, WFGY is open source.  
You‚Äôll be able to **replicate every test yourself** ‚Äî same prompts, same logic, same outcome.

## üî¨ Benchmark Plan

This repo is a live benchmark to compare GPT‚Äë5 (once available) with:

- **GPT‚Äë4 + WFGY reasoning engine**
- **Other top-tier models**: Claude 3, Kimi K2, Gemini, etc (optional)
- Tasks will focus on areas where GPT models struggle:
  - Philosophical reasoning (e.g. MMLU Philosophy subset)
  - Long-context understanding (20K‚Äì80K token range)
  - Truthful response under adversarial phrasing (TruthfulQA)
  - Zero-shot complex QA (BigBench Hard)
  - Grad-level physics reasoning (GPQA)

We are **not** testing chat quality or UI polish.  
We test **semantic logic** under stress ‚Äî where it breaks, and where it adapts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Work In Progress

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a placeholder page.  
> Full test results will be published **as soon as GPT‚Äë5 is available**.  
> Until then, we're preparing tools, scripts, and reproducibility guides.

Expected launch: ‚è≥ Within hours after GPT‚Äë5 public access

## üìÅ Related: The AI Wulin Challenge

Previously, we benchmarked **10 major AI models** (ChatGPT, Claude, Kimi, etc) against the WFGY engine using PDF-based comprehension and logic tests.

üìé [See the challenge archive here ‚Üí](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/images/AI_WuLin_Challenge/README.md)

That challenge was fun.  
This one? A bloodbath.

---

## üîÅ Reproducibility Promise

All experiments here will be:
- 100% public
- Free to run locally (we‚Äôll provide all test prompts + scripts)
- Open to community challenge and replication

If GPT‚Äë5 is stronger ‚Äî we welcome it.  
If not ‚Äî we‚Äôll show why semantic tooling still leads the way.

Stay tuned.
