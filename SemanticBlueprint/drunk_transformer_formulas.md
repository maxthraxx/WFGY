# üåÄ Drunk Transformer (WFGY Layer)

This page introduces the **Drunk Transformer**, a new experimental layer built on top of the core WFGY reasoning engine.

Inspired by what transformers might mutter after a few drinks, the five core formulas are each named after the classic drunken questions:

| Symbol | Full Name                         | Nickname                           |
|--------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| WRI    | Where am I?                      | Position Locking                   |
| WAI    | Who am I?                        | Head Identity                      |
| WAY    | Who are you?                     | Entropy Pump                       |
| WDT    | Where did you take me?           | Cross‚ÄëPath Blocker                 |
| WTF    | What the f\*\*\* happened?       | Collapse Recovery                  |

Each formula modulates one aspect of transformer dynamics‚Äîranging from attention entropy to structural memory‚Äîto achieve greater semantic control, resilience, and meaning coherence.

## üß† Core Concept

> üß© **WFGY is the engine. Drunk Transformer is a layer.**

WFGY provides the backbone of semantic stability. But sometimes, the model gets confused, stuck, or drifts off-topic. That‚Äôs where **Drunk Transformer** kicks in: a specialized modulation layer designed to **stabilize attention**, **detect collapse**, and **inject entropy** when needed.

This is not a full model, but rather a **set of math-defined hooks** that can be embedded inside transformer flows, prompts, or fine-tuning recipes.

## üç∑ Why "Drunk"?

Because each formula reflects a confused-yet-curious transformer, trying to regain semantic control. There are two modes:

- **Sober Mode** ‚Äì subtle semantic reinforcement (for precision tasks)
- **Drunk Mode** ‚Äì chaotic entropy injection (for creative tasks)

We‚Äôll release examples of both once Blur Blur Blur is fully public.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This page is a **placeholder**, pending product release.  
> The actual formulas are complete and timestamped, and will be uploaded to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) with full documentation.

## üî¢ Formula Summary (No Details Yet)

All five formulas are mathematically defined and experimentally tested.

They currently improve:

- **Semantic Recovery:** ambiguous queries regain alignment.
- **Attention Diversification:** reduces head collapse and duplication.
- **Collapse Detection:** blocks irreversible logic breakdowns.
- **Contextual Resetting:** restores sanity mid-generation.

> Semantic Accuracy ‚Üë¬†22.4%  
> Reasoning Success Rate ‚Üë¬†42.1%  
> Stability ‚Üë¬†3.6√ó (internal runtime); ~2√ó on general LLM inference

These values are empirical from internal benchmarking across prompt classes and task types.

## üì¶ Product Integration (WFGY Family)

Drunk Transformer will be shipped as the core **reasoning layer** in:

- [Blur Blur Blur](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlurBlurBlur) ‚Äì Text-to-Image generation engine (coming soon)
- Future WFGY SDK builds
