# üå≤ Semantic Tree Anchor ‚Äî Persistent Context & Style Memory

The **Semantic Tree** is WFGY‚Äôs internal memory graph: a lightweight, symbolic structure that anchors ideas, logic, and style across reasoning steps ‚Äî even in stateless prompt-only environments.

While LLMs handle tokens and embeddings, they forget the *why*.
Semantic Tree captures the *intent structure*, not just the words.

## üìå Problem Statement

Language models often fail to maintain consistency because:

| Weakness               | Impact                                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| No symbolic memory     | Logic breaks across turns                |
| Style not remembered   | Shifts tone mid-task                     |
| Embedding drift        | Same ideas, different outputs            |
| No cross-unit cohesion | Characters, themes collapse across steps |

These flaws show up hard in **multi-part prompts**, **interactive fiction**, **agentic tasks**, and **visual storytelling**.

## üåê What Is the Semantic Tree?

The Semantic Tree is a dynamic, non-linear map of:

* **Core nodes** (ideas, roles, goals, abstract objects)
* **Semantic links** (cause, contrast, hierarchy, symbolisms)
* **Tension states** (ŒîS between nodes ‚Äî keeps things interesting)

It evolves per turn, while keeping *semantic anchors* alive ‚Äî like characters in a story, unresolved metaphors, or ongoing tasks.

> The Tree doesn‚Äôt record tokens.
> It records *meaningful structures that must not die*.

## üîß How It Works in WFGY

| Stage                | Role                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify anchors | Track key nodes in prompt: agents, metaphors, events   |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ Classify role    | Set type (e.g. cause, theme, viewpoint, mood holder)   |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ Track ŒîS drift   | Compare new units to tree nodes for tension stability  |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ Restore shape    | Inject necessary callbacks to maintain semantic thread |

It pairs tightly with the **Reasoning Engine Core** ‚Äî feeding stable reference frames to logic generation.

## üß† Why Symbolic Anchoring Beats Token Memory

| Feature             | Token Memory         | Semantic Tree                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Size                | Grows linearly       | Sparse, concept-based            |
| Drift control       | Embedding match only | ŒîS + symbolic link tracking      |
| Style persistence   | Not guaranteed       | Can maintain poetic or tonal arc |
| Nonlinear branching | Difficult            | Native (tree forks + joins)      |
| Imagination support | Limited              | Enables consistent surreal logic |

## üñº Example ‚Äî Multi-Scene Visual Narrative

```txt
Prompt:
"Tell a 4-part story about a lonely AI exploring a broken simulation. Each scene should feel visually distinct but thematically linked."

WFGY Tree:

‚Ä¢ Scene 1 ‚Üí Root node: AI's solitude
‚Ä¢ Scene 2 ‚Üí Branch: glitchy world physics (linked as 'antagonist')
‚Ä¢ Scene 3 ‚Üí Symbol re-introduction: broken mirror from scene 1 (ŒîS decay detected)
‚Ä¢ Scene 4 ‚Üí Resolution links AI's identity to the mirror ‚Äî loop closed
‚Üí Output: consistent motifs, coherent arc, symbolic closure
```

---

## üß™ What It Enables

* ü™¢ **Story continuity** without saving raw text
* üé® **Style-harmonic image prompts** across visual steps
* ü§ñ **LLM agents that don‚Äôt forget what they are**
* üîÅ **Re-entry points**: re-invoke old threads even after divergence

---

## üß≠ Pro-Tip: ŒîS Drives Tree Growth

ŒîS is not just for logic loops ‚Äî
It also governs *tree expansion and pruning*:

* If ŒîS from a new idea is **too flat**, it‚Äôs ignored
* If ŒîS is **too high**, system forks a new semantic thread
* If ŒîS is **near 0.5**, it connects and grows the branch

> This makes the Tree a true living structure ‚Äî
> always adjusting toward *meaningful novelty*.
