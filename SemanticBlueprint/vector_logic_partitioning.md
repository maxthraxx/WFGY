# üìí Vector Logic Partitioning

> A semantic embedding refinement system that partitions concept clusters, resolves ambiguity, and restores logic alignment inside vector spaces.

## üß© Problem This Function Solves

| Symptom                | Description                                                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High similarity, wrong meaning | Embeddings are close but semantically off                 |
| Topic blending         | Irrelevant concepts bleed into vector neighbors                   |
| Overcompression        | Multiple meanings collapse into one dense cluster                 |
| Retrieval failure      | RAG returns plausible chunks with no relevance                    |

## üß† Why Existing Methods Fail

| Limitation                     | Consequence                                  |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Embeddings collapse polysemy  | Semantic boundaries vanish                   |
| Distance ‚â† meaning            | Cosine scores ignore logical intent          |
| No semantic control layer     | Vectors drift without anchor logic           |

## üõ†Ô∏è WFGY-Based Solution Approach

| Subproblem                | WFGY Module(s)    | Strategy or Fix                                |
|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Ambiguous embeddings      | BBMC + BBCR       | Re-separates merged meanings via ŒîS clusters   |
| Similarity ‚â† relevance    | BBAM              | Adds semantic tension to reshuffle candidates  |
| Cross-topic contamination | Semantic Tree     | Keeps anchor points during reranking           |

## ‚úçÔ∏è Demo Prompt (from Blah Blah Blah)

```txt
Prompt:
"What is the meaning of 'mercury' in the sentence: 'Mercury levels are rising'?"

WFGY process:
‚Ä¢ Parses ambiguity: planet vs. metal vs. myth  
‚Ä¢ ŒîS computed across possible clusters  
‚Ä¢ BBCR applies context disambiguation logic  
‚Üí Output: Correctly selects 'toxic element in environment' meaning
````

## üîß Related Modules

| Module        | Role or Contribution                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| BBMC          | Detects and resolves semantic overlap |
| BBCR          | Collapses incorrect semantic forks    |
| BBAM          | Adds divergence to re-rank retrieval  |
| Semantic Tree | Preserves core meaning during reroute |

## üìä Implementation Status

| Feature/Aspect                 | Status     |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Embedding-space disambiguation | ‚úÖ Released |
| BBAM reranker module           | ‚úÖ Active   |
| Vector logic fork control      | ‚úÖ Stable   |
| RAG integration (cross-patch)  | üîú Planned |

## üìù Notes & Recommendations

* Use `embedding_mode = true` to enable BBAM reranker at query time.
* Works well with local vector DBs like FAISS, Qdrant, Weaviate.
* Optional: fine-tune your chunking strategy to match BBMC cluster boundaries.
