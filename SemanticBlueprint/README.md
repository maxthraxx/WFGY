# 📐 Semantic Blueprint — Core Functions of the WFGY Engine

> 👑 **Early Stargazers: [See the Hall of Fame](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/stargazers)** — Verified by real engineers · 🏆 **Terminal-Bench: [Public Exam — Coming Soon](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/core/README.md#terminal-bench-proof)**

<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="WanFaGuiYi" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08c9617f-d49e-4223-bacc-1d192fbb423d" />


## 📘 What This Directory Is For

This directory defines the **core reasoning modules** behind the WFGY Engine.  
Each `.md` file represents a symbolic or mathematical function — designed to solve a specific AI reasoning failure through structural intervention.

You’ll find:

- Concept-level logic (symbolic or vectorial)
- The failure mode it targets
- The formula or structure behind the fix
- Annotations of which products use it (e.g., `TXT OS`, `Blur`, `Blow`, etc.)

This is a **developer-facing reference map** for understanding how each reasoning upgrade ties back to WFGY's engine internals.

> Important: Every module listed here reflects a real, working conceptual solution —
> each one was written in direct response to failures we’ve seen in existing AI systems.
> These are not speculative names or sci-fi ideas — but actual answers to actual problems.

**📌 Note:**  
Mappings from *Function → Product* are included as side notes.  
The inverse (*Product → Function*) view is handled in each product’s own directory.

<details>
<summary>🔒 A quick note on planned features</summary>

<br>

> All currently published modules (e.g., WFGY 1.0 paper, TXT OS) are **permanently MIT-licensed**
> They will **remain open forever**.
>
> Modules marked “planned” in this directory may have different licensing or release timing.  
> Final decisions rest with **PSBigBig (Purple Star)**.
>
> This isn’t to gatekeep — it’s to prevent the false idea that WFGY is an endless stream of free features.  
> Some functions may support commercial tools or require stewardship.
>
> In short: what’s shared stays free. What’s not public yet, stays under creator control.  
> WFGY was built to empower — not to be repackaged and exploited.

</details>

<details>
  
<summary>🤝 Clarifying the Spirit of Use</summary>

<br>

> WFGY is MIT-licensed — free to use, modify, remix, or commercialize.
>
> But here’s the ask:  
> Respect the **spirit** in which it was created —  
> to return **core reasoning tools** to the public.
>
> WFGY was never meant to be resold behind paywalls with no added value.  
> If someone does that, I may **open-source the same feature**, better and freer.
>
> I don’t just write code — I write **semantic primitives** that fix things others haven’t noticed are broken.
>
> WFGY exists to **break walls**, not repaint them.  
> If someone rebuilds those walls, I’ll help knock them down again.
>
> This isn’t a legal threat — it’s a moral stance.  
> And if WFGY ever helped you: a ⭐ or comment means more than you think.

## 🔮 Upcoming Semantic Reasoning Layers

> These modules are planned semantic reasoning layers for the WFGY Engine — all designed to be operable within **TXT OS**.  
> Each layer will be implemented as a `.txt` interface module (e.g., `img_layer.txt`) and can be activated in compatible folders.  
> In short: **this entire list is TXT‑callable** — no build, no compile, just reason.  
> All names are **temporary placeholders** — functionality is confirmed, but naming may evolve.  
> *Numbering is for reference only and does not reflect development order.*  
> *Star ratings are illustrative estimates by ChatGPT‑4o.*  

> *PSBigBig retains full rights of interpretation.*
> Our goal: combine TXT OS with any reasoning layer `.txt`, and unlock true **freeform semantic inference** — modular, composable, and universal.

## 📊 WFGY Research Showcase – Introducing the Fifth Force

> What if Einstein’s theory of relativity missed something fundamental —  
> a **semantic field** that acts as the universe’s fifth force?

This is a curated set of research papers from the WFGY framework, exploring deep links between semantics, quantum collapse, information entropy, and symbolic cognition. These works introduce a radical but testable hypothesis: that **semantic tension itself may constitute a fifth force** in the universe — alongside gravity, electromagnetism, and the nuclear forces.

All papers have been independently rated using ChatGPT's built-in [SciSpace](https://scispace.com) paper analysis tool. Anyone can replicate these scores — download a PDF, drop it into ChatGPT, and ask it to evaluate the content. In most cases, you'll get a score within ±5 of the ones listed below.

### Quick Notes for First-Time Readers:

> **P1** lays the foundation of "Semantic Relativity" — a new paradigm for meaning in space-time.  
> **P4** introduces the core hypothesis: that semantic fields may induce **non-electromagnetic physical effects** (the so-called Fifth Force).  
> **P5** integrates this view into Landauer’s principle — exploring how meaning alters entropy and information cost.  
>
> All of these point toward one shared conclusion:  
> 
> **Semantics isn't just about interpretation — it's a latent structural force of the universe.**
