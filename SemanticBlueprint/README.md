# 📐 Semantic Blueprint — Core Functions of the WFGY Engine
### Designing the Logic That Holds the Universe Together."

> This directory documents the **function-level logic** of the WFGY Engine.  
> Each file here represents a specific reasoning capability or symbolic intervention unit.  
>  
> **📌 Function → Product mapping appears only as side-notes.**  
> (The inverse view — *Product → Function* — is handled in each product's own directory like `TXT OS`, `Blur`, `Blow`, etc.)

## 📘 What This Directory Is For

This folder exists to define **core reasoning modules** behind WFGY's performance.  
Each `.md` file here details:

- The conceptual function logic (symbolic or mathematical)  
- The AI reasoning failure it solves  
- The formulaic or structural intervention behind it  
- Which product(s) internally rely on it (as annotations only)

It serves as a developer-facing **function reference map**,  
so contributors can trace each feature’s reasoning upgrade back to its engine roots.

---

> 🔒 A quick note on planned features:
>
> All modules currently open-sourced here are **permanently MIT-licensed**.
> That commitment is final — anything already published (e.g., WFGY 1.0 paper, TXT OS) and backed on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) will remain open forever.
>
> However, for modules listed as “planned” in this directory (or referenced via upcoming function names),  
> final decisions regarding open-sourcing remain with **PSBigBig (Purple Star)**.
>
> This is to avoid the misconception that WFGY is an infinite stream of free features.  
> Some future capabilities may support commercial projects, require ongoing stewardship, or be released with different timing.
>
> Please understand: what’s already shared will never be revoked.  
> But what’s not yet public — stays under creator control until the time is right.
>
> WFGY’s spirit is to return core reasoning tools to humanity — not to support careless repackaging or exploitative behavior.
>
> WFGY is open — but not naive.  
> It exists to empower, not to be exploited.

> WFGY is released under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) —

> > Please respect the **spirit** in which this system was created:  
> > **To return foundational reasoning tools back to humanity.**  
>  
> WFGY lowers the barrier to building complex AI reasoning systems.  
> It was never meant to be **copied, minimally repackaged, and sold at high markup** —  
> especially not by those who offer no meaningful improvement, insight, or respect for the ecosystem.
