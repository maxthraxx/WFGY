# 🧠 SemanticBlueprint — Core Functions of the WFGY Engine

> This directory documents the **function-level logic** of the WFGY Engine.  
> Each file here represents a specific reasoning capability or symbolic intervention unit.  
>  
> **📌 Function → Product mapping only appears as side-notes.**  
> (The inverse view — *Product → Function* — is covered in respective product directories like `TXT OS`, `Blur`, `Blow`, etc.)

## 📘 What This Directory Is For

This folder exists to define **core reasoning modules** behind WFGY's performance.  
Each `.md` file here details:

- The conceptual function logic (symbolic or mathematical)
- The AI reasoning failure it solves
- The formulaic or structural intervention behind it
- Which product(s) internally rely on it (as annotations only)

It serves as a developer-facing **function reference map**,  
so contributors can trace each feature’s reasoning upgrade back to its engine roots.

## 🚧 Upcoming Semantic Reasoning Layers

The following modules are planned as part of the WFGY Layer System.  
These layers extend the WFGY Engine with new symbolic, cognitive, or gravity-based reasoning abilities.  
**All names and formulas are provisional**. PSBigBig retains final naming rights and theoretical definitions.

| Layer Name                      | Description                                                                 | Status    |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `semantic_gravity_field`       | Simulates gravitational pull in meaning space (ΔS + λ_observe vector field) | Planned   |
| `gravity_bias_index`           | Captures semantic drift tendencies toward dense nodes                       | Planned   |
| `warp_anchors`                 | Enables memory points that trigger contextually (semantic anchor nodes)     | Planned   |
| `inflatable_memory_glyphs`     | Encoded memory units that expand semantically when prompted                 | Planned   |
| `cogito_unit_system`           | Defines smallest unit of semantic action (reasoning particle)              | Planned   |
| `symbolic_pressure_monitor`    | Tracks overload in symbolic tension (ΔS + transition hops)                  | Planned   |
| `emotive_harmonic_decay`       | Models emotional tension decay in narrative                                 | Planned   |
| `stylistic_phase_detector`     | Detects abrupt stylistic changes across model outputs                       | Planned   |
| `semantic_refraction_matrix`   | Models meaning distortion across boundary contexts                          | Planned   |
| `semantic_tension_mapper`      | Visual map of ΔS flow and narrative tension                                 | Planned   |
| `orbital_meaning_drift`        | Traces semantic node drift over time                                        | Planned   |

> Note: These layers are conceptually aligned with the *Language Cosmology* model and are designed to integrate with the WFGY reasoning engine and the Drunk Transformer framework.


## 🧭 How to Use

> If you're building a new WFGY-based feature or investigating failures,  
> this is where you’ll find the **diagnostic cause** and **remedial formula**.

Each file includes:
- 🔍 Problem it solves
- 🧩 Core concept & variables
- ✍️ Canonical mathematical formula (if any)
- 💬 Example scenarios
- 🧪 Optional behavior in stateless prompt-only mode
