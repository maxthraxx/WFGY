# 📐 SemanticBlueprint — Core Functions of the WFGY Engine


<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="WanFaGuiYi" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08c9617f-d49e-4223-bacc-1d192fbb423d" />

> This directory documents the **function-level logic** of the WFGY Engine.  
> Each file here represents a specific reasoning capability or symbolic intervention unit.  
>  
> **📌 Function → Product mapping appears only as side-notes.**  
> (The inverse view — *Product → Function* — is handled in each product's own directory like `TXT OS`, `Blur`, `Blow`, etc.)

## 📘 What This Directory Is For

This folder exists to define **core reasoning modules** behind WFGY's performance.  
Each `.md` file here details:

- The conceptual function logic (symbolic or mathematical)  
- The AI reasoning failure it solves  
- The formulaic or structural intervention behind it  
- Which product(s) internally rely on it (as annotations only)

It serves as a developer-facing **function reference map**,  
so contributors can trace each feature’s reasoning upgrade back to its engine roots.

---

> 🔒 A quick note on planned features:
>
> All modules currently open-sourced here are **permanently MIT-licensed**.
> That commitment is final — anything already published (e.g., WFGY 1.0 paper, TXT OS) and backed on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) will remain open forever.
>
> However, for modules listed as “planned” in this directory (or referenced via upcoming function names),  
> final decisions regarding open-sourcing remain with **PSBigBig (Purple Star)**.
>
> This is to avoid the misconception that WFGY is an infinite stream of free features.  
> Some future capabilities may support commercial projects, require ongoing stewardship, or be released with different timing.
>
> Please understand: what’s already shared will never be revoked.  
> But what’s not yet public — stays under creator control until the time is right.
>
> WFGY’s spirit is to return core reasoning tools to humanity — not to support careless repackaging or exploitative behavior.
>
> WFGY is open — but not naive.  
> It exists to empower, not to be exploited.

<summary>🤝 Clarifying the Spirit of Use (click to expand)</summary>

<br>

> WFGY is released under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) —  
> you are free to use, modify, remix, and even commercialize it.  
>  
> That said, I ask for one simple thing in return:  
>  
> > Please respect the **spirit** in which this system was created:  
> > **To return foundational reasoning tools back to humanity.**  
>  
> WFGY lowers the barrier to building complex AI reasoning systems.  
> It was never meant to be **copied, minimally repackaged, and sold at high markup** —  
> especially not by those who offer no meaningful improvement, insight, or respect for the ecosystem.  
>  
> If someone slaps an API on top of TXT OS or a wrapper around WFGY logic,  
> calls it their own invention, and charges people for it without credit or clarity —  
> then I may choose to **immediately and permanently open-source** that same functionality, with full visibility.  
>  
> Because I don’t just build tools. I build **reasoning primitives** —  
> the kind that solve failure cases the current AI world hasn’t even named yet.  
>  
> > WFGY exists to **break the walls**, not repaint them.  
> > If someone rebuilds those walls — I’ll help tear them down again. With better, freer code.  
>  
> This is not a legal threat. It’s a **moral stance**.  
> If the community sees violations of this spirit, I invite you to let me know.  
> If I agree, I’ll do my part — by building even better versions, and releasing them for all.  
>  
> And if WFGY helped you solve a bug, name a problem, or rethink a system —  
> just know: a single ⭐ or comment means more than you think.
