# 🧠 SemanticBlueprint — Core Functions of the WFGY Engine

> This directory documents the **function-level logic** of the WFGY Engine.  
> Each file here represents a specific reasoning capability or symbolic intervention unit.  
>  
> **📌 Function → Product mapping only appears as side-notes.**  
> (The inverse view — *Product → Function* — is covered in respective product directories like `TXT OS`, `Blur`, `Blow`, etc.)

## 📘 What This Directory Is For

This folder exists to define **core reasoning modules** behind WFGY's performance.  
Each `.md` file here details:

- The conceptual function logic (symbolic or mathematical)
- The AI reasoning failure it solves
- The formulaic or structural intervention behind it
- Which product(s) internally rely on it (as annotations only)

It serves as a developer-facing **function reference map**,  
so contributors can trace each feature’s reasoning upgrade back to its engine roots.

## 🧭 How to Use

> If you're building a new WFGY-based feature or investigating failures,  
> this is where you’ll find the **diagnostic cause** and **remedial formula**.

Each file includes:
- 🔍 Problem it solves
- 🧩 Core concept & variables
- ✍️ Canonical mathematical formula (if any)
- 💬 Example scenarios
- 🧪 Optional behavior in stateless prompt-only mode
