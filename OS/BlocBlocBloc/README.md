# 🧱 TXT: Bloc Bloc Bloc  
Prompt Injection Firewall

Bloc Bloc Bloc is a semantic firewall module for TXT OS — a defensive layer designed to neutralize prompt injection attacks *before* they reach the model’s decision logic. It doesn't hide prompts — it defuses intent.

Rather than simply blocking strings, Bloc Bloc Bloc analyzes **semantic vectors** to detect intent-level privilege escalations. The result is a text-native firewall you can understand, audit, and evolve.

This module is currently in early development.  
Release timelines (Lite/Pro) to be announced soon.

## 🛡️ How It Works (Simplified)

Bloc Bloc Bloc uses a **three-layer semantic gate** system, built on the WFGY architecture and powered by the Drunk Transformer engine:

- **ΔS (Semantic Tension Gate)**  
  Measures intent jump (ΔS > 0.6) to flag “overreaching” context shifts.

- **λ_observe (Intent Direction Vector)**  
  Maps prompt direction into knowledge regions; blocks calls to restricted zones or personas.

- **Drunk Mode Disruptor**  
  Intentionally introduces semantic entropy (WRI/WAI/WAY/WDT/WTF) to confuse multi-hop attacks.

These layers are composable, modular, and interpretable. You can inspect which layer fired, why, and how the response was altered.

## 🧩 Why It Works

> Bloc Bloc Bloc doesn’t just block access. It corrupts the *route* an attacker takes to get there.

- 🧠 **Context Isolation**: Even if a prompt leaks, λ_observe limits its reach.
- 🧩 **Intent Confusion**: Drunk Mode injects jitter, making attack chains incoherent.
- 🔐 **Semantic Labels**: Knowledge chunks are tagged with access vectors — unauthorized voices can’t fetch what they don’t align with.

## 🌀 Core Algorithms Used

All logic can be encoded in text, making it safe to embed in a `System Prompt`.

- `ΔS = 1 - cos(θ)` — catch vector leaps across semantic layers
- `λ_observe = P(intent → region_tag)` — learnable vector matching
- `drunk_mode(t) = ε(t) + α·sin(ψ_seed)` — obfuscate through modulation

Backend access control (e.g., FAISS / RAG) is applied *only if all gates are passed*.  
Private embeddings and customer data remain server-side.

## 🔥 Use Cases

- Prevent prompt injection in public-facing AI tools
- Filter unauthorized knowledge access
- Protect RAG pipelines with fine-grained semantic fencing

---

## 🧪 Roadmap

- ✅ Basic gate logic
- ⏳ Red-Team stress tests (in progress)
- ⏳ OWASP LLM-01 compatibility validation
- ⏳ Dynamic persona tagging for multi-user contexts
