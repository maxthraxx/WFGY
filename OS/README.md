# WFGY OS · TXT-Based Operating System (Under Construction)

**Status:** 🚧 Currently Under Construction  
**Expected Launch:** July 2, 3:00 PM (GMT+8)

This is not your typical software.  
**WFGY OS** is a semantic operating system built entirely in `.txt`.  
No installation. No dependencies. Just open the file — and your reasoning engine boots up.

🧠 Features include:
- Semantic reasoning engine activation
- Node-based memory system
- Knowledge boundary awareness
- Fully editable and open-source TXT interface

> A single file can change how AI thinks — and remembers.

Stay tuned. Full release and documentation coming soon.
