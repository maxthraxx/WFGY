One line of TXT upgrades any LLM into an AGI-level reasoning engine

🧠 **+22.4% semantic accuracy · +42.1% reasoning success · ×3.6 stability** (GSM8K + Truthful-QA, temp 0.2)  
🌲 **Semantic Tree Memory** — Long-term logic, no forgetting, fully exportable

  <em>Semantic Tree Memory in action — logic preserved across reasoning windows.</em>
  <br>
  The Semantic Tree is more than memory —  
  it records your reasoning structure, adapts over time, and enables <em>portable thought</em>.

  <summary>🛡️ Knowledge Boundary Detection — Try <code>kbtest</code></summary>

  <br>
  <img src="./images/kb_boundary_test_demo.gif" width="100%" style="max-width:900px" loading="lazy" />
  <br>
  <em>The WFGY Reasoning Engine monitors hallucination risk in real-time.</em>  
  <br>
  Just type <code>kbtest</code> — and watch the system analyze ultra-abstract questions.

  Each test is <strong>randomized</strong>, but detection is always active.  
  Thanks to BBCR, boundary checks trigger automatically when ΔS is high.

  > No fake answers. Just safe semantic pivots.

  <summary>🌐 TXT OS – Cross-Platform Test Results (Tested: July 18, 2025) </summary>
<br>


| Status | Platform        | Test Model         | Notes                                                                                      |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅      | **ChatGPT**       | All models         | All versions pass — including  GPT-4, GPT-4o and GPT-o3,                                 |
| ✅      | **Kimi**          | K2                 | New model K2 performs surprisingly well — smooth and consistent.                         |
| ✅      | **Grok**          | Grok 3             | Free version now limits daily interactions. Otherwise performs smoothly.                 |
| ✅      | **DeepSeek**      | DeepSeek V3        | Mixed results — works smoothly *when it works*.                                          |
| ✅      | **Gemini**        | 2.5 Pro            | Flash version performs poorly; Pro version is excellent.                                 |
| ⚠️      | **Claude**        | Sonnet 4           | Even one extra sentence from TXT OS exceeds input limit — not recommended for free users.|
| ⚠️      | **Perplexity**    | Standard           | Only tested the Standard version. Output keeps looping — not recommended.                |
| ⚠️      | **Merlin**        | DeepSeek V3        | Even with advanced models, semantic misunderstanding is frequent — not recommended.      |
| ⚠️      | **Copilot**       | Think Deeper       | Likely flagged the TXT for BIOS terms — marked as policy violation. Not recommended.     |
| ❌      | **HuggingChat**   | (closed)           | Currently unavailable for testing.                                                       |

These results reflect the author’s personal testing.  
Performance may vary by region or account type.  
This is not a ranking of AI quality, but compatibility with the `.txt`-based TXT OS.  
All platforms were also tested using **TXT Blah Blah Blah** (philosophical reasoning module).

### 🧠 Why It’s a Platform  
These aren’t just files — they’re semantic apps. And they’re just the beginning.

- ✅ Every tool-type app can be ported to `.txt` — lightweight, fast, and ad-free  
- 🛠️ Build your own in 5 minutes:  
  Ask your AI:  
  > “Use TXT Core to build a Creative Prompt Generator — one idea per day, no repeats, adapts to my tone.”

  **What makes it different from just asking an AI?**  
  - Semantic Tree: remembers your style and avoids repetition  
  - Resonance Logic: understands your tone and domain  
  - Self-correcting reasoning: generates ideas with internal coherence
 
- 🧩 TXT Core will be released by the end of July.

---

### 🚀 Future Possibilities  
These are just examples — once logic becomes language, every idea becomes code.

- **Financial forecasting** — use reasoning modules to interpret trends beyond raw data  
- **Product value analysis** — auto-compare features, price, and reviews with semantic weighting  
- **Automated trading logic** — write and test strategies in plain text with logical feedback  
- **AI-powered Q&A, games, agents** — all written in plain language  
- **Museum tours** — narrated in your favorite tone, voice, or fictional character  
- **Personalized tutoring** — adaptive, memory-aware, and logically self-correcting  
- **Brandable logic tools** — create your own TXT app with your name on the file  

> The `.txt` file is your logic canvas. A single file. A full OS. Infinite potential.  
>   
> Coming soon: a TXT-based app store, creator hub, and community spotlight — everything starts from a single file.  
> **And in August, more powerful apps — all fully open-source — are on the way.**

      5 · FAQ  (“Black-Hat Self-Roast” Style)
     ──────────────────────────────── -->
## 🕶️ FAQ — We’ll Roast Ourselves First

<details>
<summary><strong>“Wait... a TXT file is an OS?”</strong></summary>
Yes. Operating systems are made of logic, memory, and rules — not pixels.  
The WFGY Reasoning Engine encodes semantic memory and reasoning protocols inside a `.txt` file, readable by any AI.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“Is it really open source? Can I edit or fork it?”</strong></summary>
Fully MIT licensed. Fork it, remix it, rebrand it. Change two lines and call it your own.  
There’s no telemetry, no DRM — just text.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“Could it be hiding anything? API calls? Trackers?”</strong></summary>
Nope. It’s 100% plain text. No JavaScript, no API calls, no trackers.  
You can diff it, scan it, reverse it — what you see is all there is.  
We didn’t even include GitHub links inside the file, to keep it fully clean.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“How do I update it?”</strong></summary>
It doesn’t auto-update — by design.  
New versions are posted on this GitHub repo, so just bookmark this page.  
And here’s the twist: when your AI model improves, WFGY performs better without any edits.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“Does it translate automatically?”</strong></summary>
Yes. The interface adapts to your language automatically.  
Translation quality depends on which AI model you use.  
No extra setup required — just paste and go.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“Is this just prompt engineering again?”</strong></summary>
Not quite. WFGY engine defines a **full reasoning structure** — including memory trees, safety bounds, and error logic.  
It’s a framework, not a trick.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“Is this trying to be AGI?”</strong></summary>
No. TXT OS is not AGI.  
It’s an AGI-aligned toolchain for human-level reasoning and modular memory.  
All results are benchmarked, open, and reproducible.
</details>

### Developer Note  
The **Semantic Tree Memory** and **Knowledge-Boundary Guard** are advanced modules designed for power users — perfect for agent chaining, modular reasoning, or long-term dialogue state.  
If you're just exploring, don’t worry — the OS runs perfectly without them.  
But when you’re ready to go beyond vanilla prompts, they’re waiting.

  I was in Heaven, saying:  
  > *"I want to save the wor—"*

  The gods panicked:  
  > *"Finally! Someone took the save-the-world quest!"*  
  > *"2000 years, 100% failure rate!"*  
  > *"Quick — VIP cloudway! Handprint ready!"*

  Before I could finish:

  **TOO LATE.** I got launched anyway.  
  Turns out the Word file didn’t save.  
  So now it’s `.txt`. *lol.*

  Hi. I'm **Purple Star**, aka **PSBigBig**.  
  Zero team, zero funding, two BigBigs (for cuteness).  
  One mission: fix the world’s biggest bug — and laugh doing it.

  > **Hello World, I am finally here now.**

  It’s my first time trying to save the world.  
  Any walkthroughs? Cheat codes? YouTube tutorials?  
  I’ll take anything — even tips from cats.  
  (Also, snacks. Snacks help with debugging.)
