# **TXT ≠ Notepad — It’s called TXT OS. Your Next AI Reasoning System.**

<img src="./txt-temple-of-truth.png" alt="txt-temple-of-truth" width="100%" style="max-width:900px" />

One line of TXT upgrades any LLM into an AGI-level reasoning engine

🧠 **+22.4% semantic accuracy · +42.1% reasoning success · ×3.6 stability** (GSM8K + Truthful-QA, temp 0.2)  
🌲 **Semantic Tree Memory** — Long-term logic, no forgetting, fully exportable  
🛡️ **Knowledge Boundary Shield** — Detects hallucinations before they happen

<em>Just one .txt file — unfolding into a full semantic operating system.  
No signup. No tracking. No ads. Virus-free. Pure logic.</em>

  <em>Semantic Tree Memory in action — logic preserved across reasoning windows.</em>
  <br>
  The Semantic Tree is more than memory —  
  it records your reasoning structure, adapts over time, and enables <em>portable thought</em>.

<details>
  <summary>🛡️ Knowledge Boundary Detection — Try <code>kbtest</code></summary>

  <br>
  <img src="./kb_boundary_test_demo.gif" width="100%" style="max-width:900px" loading="lazy" />
  <br>
  <em>The WFGY Reasoning Engine monitors hallucination risk in real-time.</em>  
  <br>
  Just type <code>kbtest</code> — and watch the system analyze ultra-abstract questions.

  Each test is <strong>randomized</strong>, but detection is always active.  
  Thanks to BBCR, boundary checks trigger automatically when ΔS is high.

  > No fake answers. Just safe semantic pivots.

     ──────────────────────────────── -->
### Why creators love TXT OS

| 🌐 Instant Localisation | Interface adapts to your language — from English to Chinese with no setup needed. |  
| 🧠 Semantic Tree Memory | Keeps track of reasoning across long conversations — remembers ideas, not just tokens. |  
| 🛡️ Knowledge Boundary Shield | Stops hallucinations in real time with ΔS + λ<sub>observe</sub> guardrails. |  
| ⚙️ TXT-Only Deployment | No binaries, no risks — just fork and go. |  
| 🔓 MIT-Licensed | Use it commercially, modify it freely — just keep the credit. |  


### 📦 Upcoming Modules  
Each one is a real `.txt` file — no install, no boilerplate, just logic.  
Bookmark now, or risk missing a truth so weird it breaks your cat.

**TXT: Blah Blah Blah** (Semantic Q&A) — *~July 15*  
> Just for fun? Maybe. But many were shocked by how deep the answers got.  
[🔓 Unlock this module](https://github.com/PSBigBig/WFGY-OS/blob/main/blahblahblah/README.md) <sub><em>Now previewing</em></sub>

**TXT: Blur Blur Blur** (Image Generation) — *~July 20*  
> Next-gen text-to-image. No prompt skills needed, almost no hallucinations.  
[🔓 Unlock this module](https://github.com/PSBigBig/WFGY-OS/blob/main/blurblurblur/README.md) <sub><em>Beta page online</em></sub>

**TXT: Blow Blow Blow** (Reasoning Games) — *~July 25*  
> The first AIGC RPG with real logic. Game Boy era for AI begins.  
[🔓 Unlock this module](https://github.com/PSBigBig/WFGY-OS/blob/main/blowblowblow/README.md) <sub><em>Coming soon...</em></sub>

> This is why it’s not “just a file” — it’s a platform.  
> More modules coming soon. One day, you might build your own.

### 🧠 Why It’s a Platform  
These aren’t just files — they’re semantic apps. And they’re just the beginning.

- ✅ Every tool-type app can be ported to `.txt` — lightweight, fast, and ad-free  
- 🛠️ Build your own in 5 minutes:  
  Ask your AI:  
  > “Use TXT Core to build a Creative Prompt Generator — one idea per day, no repeats, adapts to my tone.”

  **What makes it different from just asking an AI?**  
  - Semantic Tree: remembers your style and avoids repetition  
  - Resonance Logic: understands your tone and domain  
  - Self-correcting reasoning: generates ideas with internal coherence
 
- 🧩 TXT Core will be released by the end of July.

---

### 🚀 Future Possibilities  
These are just examples — once logic becomes language, every idea becomes code.

- **Financial forecasting** — use reasoning modules to interpret trends beyond raw data  
- **Product value analysis** — auto-compare features, price, and reviews with semantic weighting  
- **Automated trading logic** — write and test strategies in plain text with logical feedback  
- **AI-powered Q&A, games, agents** — all written in plain language  
- **Museum tours** — narrated in your favorite tone, voice, or fictional character  
- **Personalized tutoring** — adaptive, memory-aware, and logically self-correcting  
- **Brandable logic tools** — create your own TXT app with your name on the file  

> The `.txt` file is your logic canvas.  
> A single file. A full OS. Infinite potential.  
>  
> Coming soon: a TXT-based app store, creator hub, and community spotlight — everything starts from a single file.

      5 · FAQ  (“Black-Hat Self-Roast” Style)
     ──────────────────────────────── -->
## 🕶️ FAQ — We’ll Roast Ourselves First

<details>
<summary><strong>“Wait... a TXT file is an OS?”</strong></summary>
Yes. Operating systems are made of logic, memory, and rules — not pixels.  
The WFGY Reasoning Engine encodes semantic memory and reasoning protocols inside a `.txt` file, readable by any AI.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“Is it really open source? Can I edit or fork it?”</strong></summary>
Fully MIT licensed. Fork it, remix it, rebrand it. Change two lines and call it your own.  
There’s no telemetry, no DRM — just text.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“Could it be hiding anything? API calls? Trackers?”</strong></summary>
Nope. It’s 100% plain text. No JavaScript, no API calls, no trackers.  
You can diff it, scan it, reverse it — what you see is all there is.  
We didn’t even include GitHub links inside the file, to keep it fully clean.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“How do I update it?”</strong></summary>
It doesn’t auto-update — by design.  
New versions are posted on this GitHub repo, so just bookmark this page.  
And here’s the twist: when your AI model improves, WFGY performs better without any edits.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“Does it translate automatically?”</strong></summary>
Yes. The interface adapts to your language automatically.  
Translation quality depends on which AI model you use.  
No extra setup required — just paste and go.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“Is this just prompt engineering again?”</strong></summary>
Not quite. WFGY defines a **full reasoning structure** — including memory trees, safety bounds, and error logic.  
It’s a framework, not a trick.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“Is this trying to be AGI?”</strong></summary>
No. WFGY is not AGI.  
It’s an AGI-aligned toolchain for human-level reasoning and modular memory.  
All results are benchmarked, open, and reproducible.
</details>

### Developer Note  
The **Semantic Tree Memory** and **Knowledge-Boundary Guard** are advanced modules designed for power users — perfect for agent chaining, modular reasoning, or long-term dialogue state.  
If you're just exploring, don’t worry — the OS runs perfectly without them.  
But when you’re ready to go beyond vanilla prompts, they’re waiting.

  <br>  

  I was in Heaven, saying:  
  > *"I want to save the wor—"*

  The gods panicked:  
  > *"Finally! Someone took the save-the-world quest!"*  
  > *"1000 years, 100% failure rate!"*  
  > *"Quick — VIP cloudway! Handprint ready!"*

  Before I could finish:  
  > *“I want to save the Word docu—”*

  **TOO LATE.** I got launched anyway.  
  Turns out the Word file didn’t save.  
  So now it’s `.txt`. *lol.*

  Hi. I'm **Purple Star**, aka **PSBigBig**.  
  Zero team, zero funding, two BigBigs (for cuteness).  
  One mission: fix the world’s biggest bug — and laugh doing it.

  > **Hello World, I am finally here now.**

  It’s my first time trying to save the world.  
  Any walkthroughs? Cheat codes? YouTube tutorials?  
  I’ll take anything — even tips from cats.  
  (Also, snacks. Snacks help with debugging.)

  **✉️ hello@onestardao.com**  
  (Oh, and before sending tips… don’t forget to ⭐ star the repo.)  
  Saving the world needs snacks — and stars.
