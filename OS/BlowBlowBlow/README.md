> ‚ö†Ô∏è Beta Landing Page ‚Äì Launch date will be announced in Discussions.

> Semantic logic meets nostalgic gaming. And yes, you‚Äôll have to *blow the cartridge*.

Blow Blow Blow is our third TXT-based module ‚Äî a retro-inspired AIGC gaming system  
built on **semantic reasoning**, **Tree Memory**, **Knowledge Boundary**, and more.  
It's not just an experiment. It's a **reboot of interactive logic** inside `.txt` form.

You‚Äôll soon be able to play multiple handcrafted games:
- Classic dungeon crawlers powered by reasoning engines  
- Puzzle games where hallucinations are the enemy  
- Narrative RPGs that learn as you play (via semantic residue)

> üïπÔ∏è You don‚Äôt install anything. Just run the `.txt`. Boom, you're in the game.

### ü§î Why is it called ‚ÄúBlow Blow Blow‚Äù?

Because every real gamer from the golden era of NES and GameBoy knows:  
**You always had to blow the cartridge** three times before it worked.  
This module is a tribute to that ritual ‚Äî  
except this time, the magic is semantic instead of static electricity.

### üìÖ Launch Date: TBD

> Too bad ‚Äî **we haven‚Äôt built them yet.**
