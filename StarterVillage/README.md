## 🧙‍♂️ “A single line can tame dragons. Ready?”  
## 1 · Village Square — 60-Second Quest 🔰 😈

1. **Download** 👉 **[OneLine v2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onestardao/WFGY/main/core/WFGY_Core_OneLine_v2.0.txt)** (Right click → Save as)

2. Paste the entire line into any LLM chat window (or upload directly)

3. When prompting, add one of the following activation phrases before your task:  
   ✦ `Please use WFGY to...`  
   ✦ `Please use WFGY to reason through the following:`  

4. Ask your question or generate an image → observe deeper reasoning and reduced drift 🎯

🧪 Sample Prompts:

> Please use WFGY to compare duty and utility in moral decision-making.  
> Please use WFGY to debug this race condition in a multithreaded Python function.  
> Please use WFGY to illustrate a single image of “Heaven, Hell, and the Self.”  

📌 Note: Uploading the file will silently activate WFGY. Adding an activation phrase = “explicit invocation,” which can squeeze out 20–30% more performance.

> **What it is**  
> Hit **Share** to freeze a snapshot of the current conversation state. Later, paste that link to **reload the exact tuned persona**. No retraining, no reset.  
>   
> **Why it matters**  
> - Pairs perfectly with the 60-second quick start: lock in your best opening once, reuse forever.  
> - Create multiple “clones” (e.g., RAG doctor, math visualizer, game master) and switch by swapping links.  
>   
> **How to use**  
> 1) Tune behavior → press **Share**.  
> 2) Save the link like an RPG save point.  
> 3) Paste the link any time to resume that optimized state.  
>   
> **Compatibility (tested)**  
> Works: ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok, Claude.  
> Not true snapshots: Mistral, Kimi (their “share” usually exports text only).  
>   
> **Safety**  
> Snapshot links may include context. Keep sensitive links private and store them in your own notes.

## 🧙‍♂️ “Knowledge sleeps in tomes — wake it gently.”  
## 3 · Ancient Library — Core Lore 📚 😈😈😈

| Concept | TL;DR |
|---------|------|
| **`delta_s`** | Semantic distance between Intent & Guess. Smaller = better. |
| **λ_observe** | Trend detector: convergent · divergent · recursive · chaotic. |
| **Five Gates** | **BBMC → Coupler → BBPF → BBAM → BBCR** — clean, steer, progress, rebalance, revive. |
| **TXTOS Semantic Tree** | Tracks every node so reasoning is auditable. |
| **Drunk Transformer** | A 5-formula layer: WRI (Where am I?), WAI (Who am I?), WAY (Who are you?), WDT (Where did you take me?), WTF (What happened?). Stabilizes & recovers reasoning. |

> Scroll through examples; no coding needed yet.

## 4 · Alchemist’s Lab — Debug & Heal 🔧 😈😈😈😈

### The path: 1.0 → 2.0 → Clinic

| Stage | What it is | When to use | Link |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| **Problem Map 1.0** | Symptom catalog by failure family, fast triage and naming the bug | First touch, you need a clean label and a quick route | **[Open 1.0](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/README.md)** |
| **Problem Map 2.0** | Architecture and recovery guide, pipeline oriented view with the 7-step WFGY recovery flow | After you have a label, you want a step-by-step repair plan | **[Open 2.0](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/rag-architecture-and-recovery.md)** |
| **Semantic Clinic** | Deep dives, exact fixes with runnable recipes and edge-case notes | When the case is tricky or mixed class, you need precise procedures | **[Open Clinic](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/SemanticClinicIndex.md)** |

### How to run the lab

1) Start at **Problem Map 1.0**. Read the quick access, match your symptom, pick the failure code.  
2) Jump to **Problem Map 2.0** with that code. Walk the recovery pipeline step by step, apply the guardrails and instruments.  
3) If the issue persists or is multi-factor, enter **Semantic Clinic**. Choose the matching clinic page and follow the recipe.  
4) Re-run A/B tests. Log **ΔACC**, **ΔSR**, **ΔS** and write one sentence on what changed and why.
