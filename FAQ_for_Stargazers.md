Welcome — and congrats on stumbling into the strangest GitHub repo you’ll bookmark this year.  
This page is your guide to **what WFGY is**, **what TXT OS does**, and **where to start**.

## 🧠 What is WFGY?

**WFGY** (萬法歸一) is a modular semantic reasoning engine designed to solve the kinds of logic, memory, and abstraction problems that traditional LLMs often fail at.

It’s not a wrapper, not a plugin, and not just a prompt trick — it's a full **semantic loop architecture** with real math under the hood (ΔS ≈ 0.5).

## 🖥️ What is TXT OS?

**TXT OS** is a new kind of AI operating system — powered entirely by `.txt` files.  
It uses the WFGY engine under the hood to keep everything stable, logical, and expressive.

Each TXT file becomes a callable “module” with reasoning behavior — like apps, but built from semantic blueprints.

## 🧩 What can I run today?

You can try these modules now — all part of TXT OS:

| Module | Function | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| [Blah Blah Blah](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlahBlahBlah) | Semantic Q&A (Literal + Abstract) | ✅ Lite Released |
| [Blur Blur Blur](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlurBlurBlur) | Image Generation (Stable + Poetic) | ✅ Lite Released |
| [Blow Blow Blow](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlowBlowBlow) | AI Reasoning RPG Games | 🧪 In Dev  |
| [Blot Blot Blot](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlotBlotBlot) | Humanlike Writing & Persona | 🧪 In Dev |
| [Bloc Bloc Bloc](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlocBlocBloc) | Prompt Injection Firewall | 🧪 In Dev |

All modules are stackable — you can call them inside each other to build bigger apps, powered by nothing but `.txt`.

## 🗺️ Want to know what problems we already solved?

We’re building a public **Problem Map** that matches every real-world AI failure to a WFGY-based fix.

| Symptom | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Hallucination | ✅ ΔS Drift Control |
| Broken Memory | ✅ State Persistence Layer |
| Overconfident Answers | ✅ Bluff Filter |
| Symbolic Confusion | ✅ Logical Anchoring |

## ✅ Is this real? Do people actually use it?

Yes — and we track every real-world rescue in the [Hero Log](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/discussions/10).  
We’ve helped users debug everything from broken RAG to symbolic math errors.  
Some of the results surprised even us.

Also: we’re backed by the creator of Tesseract.js and many open-source engineers.

## 🚦 Where should I start?

1. Try [TXT-Blur](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlurBlurBlur) — no skills needed, results are uncanny.
2. Read the [Problem Map](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/ProblemMap) — see if we solved your headache.
3. Watch the [Hero Logs](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/discussions/10) — real people, real bugs, real logic.
4. Bookmark this page. We’re updating fast — and not always tweeting it.

## 💬 Still confused?

Good. That means you’re early.

The best way to understand WFGY is to **try one module**, read the output, and ask:  
_“Wait... how the hell did it do that?”_
