Welcome ‚Äî and congrats on stumbling into the strangest GitHub repo you‚Äôll bookmark this year.  
This page is your guide to **what WFGY is**, **what TXT OS does**, and **where to start**.

## üß† What is WFGY?

**WFGY** (Ëê¨Ê≥ïÊ≠∏‰∏Ä) is a modular semantic reasoning engine designed to solve the kinds of logic, memory, and abstraction problems that traditional LLMs often fail at.

It‚Äôs not a wrapper, not a plugin, and not just a prompt trick ‚Äî it's a full **semantic loop architecture** with real math under the hood (ŒîS ‚âà 0.5).

## üñ•Ô∏è What is TXT OS?

**TXT OS** is a new kind of AI operating system ‚Äî powered entirely by `.txt` files.  
It uses the WFGY engine under the hood to keep everything stable, logical, and expressive.

Each TXT file becomes a callable ‚Äúmodule‚Äù with reasoning behavior ‚Äî like apps, but built from semantic blueprints.

## üß© What can I run today?

You can try these modules now ‚Äî all part of TXT OS:

| Module | Function | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| [Blah Blah Blah](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlahBlahBlah) | Semantic Q&A (Literal + Abstract) | ‚úÖ Lite Released |
| [Blur Blur Blur](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlurBlurBlur) | Image Generation (Stable + Poetic) | ‚úÖ Lite Released |
| [Blow Blow Blow](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlowBlowBlow) | AI Reasoning RPG Games | üß™ In Dev  |
| [Blot Blot Blot](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlotBlotBlot) | Humanlike Writing & Persona | üß™ In Dev |
| [Bloc Bloc Bloc](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlocBlocBloc) | Prompt Injection Firewall | üß™ In Dev |

All modules are stackable ‚Äî you can call them inside each other to build bigger apps, powered by nothing but `.txt`.

## üó∫Ô∏è Want to know what problems we already solved?

We‚Äôre building a public **Problem Map** that matches every real-world AI failure to a WFGY-based fix.

| Symptom | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Hallucination | ‚úÖ ŒîS Drift Control |
| Broken Memory | ‚úÖ State Persistence Layer |
| Overconfident Answers | ‚úÖ Bluff Filter |
| Symbolic Confusion | ‚úÖ Logical Anchoring |

## ‚úÖ Is this real? Do people actually use it?

Yes ‚Äî and we track every real-world rescue. 
We‚Äôve helped users debug everything from broken RAG to symbolic math errors.  
Some of the results surprised even us.

Also: we‚Äôre backed by the creator of Tesseract.js and many open-source engineers.

## üö¶ Where should I start?

1. Try [TXT-Blur](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlurBlurBlur) ‚Äî no skills needed, results are uncanny.
2. Read the [Problem Map](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/ProblemMap) ‚Äî see if we solved your headache.
3. Bookmark this page. We‚Äôre updating fast ‚Äî and not always tweeting it.

## üí¨ Still confused?

Good. That means you‚Äôre early.

The best way to understand WFGY is to **try one module**, read the output, and ask:  
_‚ÄúWait... how the hell did it do that?‚Äù_
