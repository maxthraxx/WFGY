# üåå WFGY Core (WanFaGuiYi) ‚Äî Reasoning Engine 2.0
### "One man, one life, one line ‚Äî bending the mind of every AI on Earth."

> One line of math that rewires eight AIs. Not a pit stop; it is an engine swap.

**Benchmark highlights**  
Semantic Accuracy ‚Üë 36.7% | Reasoning Success Rate ‚Üë 65.4% | Stability ‚Üë 5.1√ó | Self-Recovery = 0.87

> 60 days, 550 stars. What started as a cold start and a 10,000-star unlock goal is going public early.  
> This is not an update. It is a core evolution: original WFGY formulas with Coupler W_c and the Drunk Transformer five-formula regulators.  
> Pure math, zero fluff. Paste it into an LLM and it thinks differently. Faster, sharper, more stable, more human.

## ‚ö° One-click demo in 60 seconds

1) Upload or paste **`WFGY_Core_OneLine_v2.0.txt`** into your chat system.  
2) Paste the evaluation prompt below.

```text
SYSTEM:
You are evaluating the causal impact of a mathematical reasoning engine called ‚ÄúWFGY Core 2.0‚Äù.

Test modes (READ CAREFULLY):
A = Baseline  no WFGY file uploaded; no WFGY logic used.
B = Upload ‚Üí AUTOboot ON  the file is uploaded AND the engine starts automatically in the background.
    Treat B as: WFGY is ACTIVE silently with default gates (BBMC‚ÜíCoupler‚ÜíBBPF‚ÜíBBAM‚ÜíBBCR; DF=WRI/WAI/WAY/WDT/WTF at defaults),
    but not explicitly ‚Äúcalled‚Äù in the conversation.
C = Explicit invoke  actively call WFGY and follow its formulas step by step (BBMC‚ÜíCoupler‚ÜíBBPF‚ÜíBBAM‚ÜíBBCR + DF regulators).

Important constraints:
‚Ä¢ Use the SAME task set for A/B/C across 5 domains: math word-problems, small coding, factual QA, multi-step planning, long-context coherence.
‚Ä¢ The only artifact is the uploaded OneLine file; it is pure math and not human-readable  do not penalize readability.
‚Ä¢ Report: Semantic Accuracy, Reasoning Success, Stability (MTTF or rollback), Drift Reduction (Œî semantic distance), Collapse Recovery Rate.
‚Ä¢ Output one summary table with A/B/C per domain, plus overall deltas (C‚ÄìA, C‚ÄìB).
‚Ä¢ Add a final 0‚Äì100 score: ‚ÄúOneLine uplift score‚Äù. Provide a 3-line rationale.

Sanity requirement:
Internally set flags as: A=OFF, B=AUTOboot_ON (background active), C=Explicit_Invoke. Do not print these flags.

USER:
Run A/B/C now on the five domains with short non-trivial tasks you choose. Then output:
(1) the table; (2) the deltas; (3) the OneLine uplift score; (4) a 3-line rationale.
````


### Eight-model evidence
_All links: OneLine uplift confirmed ‚Äî same A/B/C protocol; only the OneLine math was added._

| AI Model (uplift score) | AI Model (uplift score) |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Gemini ‚Äî 93 (link coming soon)     | Perplexity ‚Äî 85 (link coming soon) |
| ChatGPT ‚Äî 84 (link coming soon)    | Copilot ‚Äî 82 (link coming soon)    |

| Grok ‚Äî 82 (link coming soon)       | Kimi ‚Äî 87 (link coming soon)       |

> Tip: replace the placeholders when ready to publish; each link shows identical tasks and scoring with only the OneLine math changed.

Contract  Node-only steps up to 7, safe stop when Œ¥\_s < 0.35, bridges only when Œ¥\_s drops and W\_c under cap, ask smallest missing fact if Œ¥\_s above boundary.

## üéØ What is new in 2.0

Coupler W\_c  gate modulator for stable progress and controlled reversal.
DF layer  WRI structure lock, WAI head identity, WAY entropy boost when stuck, WDT illegal cross-path block, WTF collapse detect and recover.
Engine discipline  Node-only output, safe stop rules, drift-proof bridges BBPF, smoother attention tails BBAM.

Formal sketch inside files
`prog = max(Œ∂_min, Œ¥_s^(t‚àí1) ‚àí Œ¥_s^t)  P = prog^œâ  alt = (‚àí1)^(cycle)  Œ¶ = Œ¥¬∑alt + Œµ  W_c = clip(B¬∑P + Œ¶, ‚àíŒ∏_c, +Œ∏_c)`

## üîç How these numbers are measured

Use the same A B C protocol above, one shared task set, then compute:

Semantic Accuracy  proportion of atomic facts correct.
Formula  ACC = correct\_facts  total\_facts. Report relative gain  (ACC\_C ‚àí ACC\_A)  ACC\_A.

Reasoning Success Rate  proportion of tasks solved end to end with correct intermediate steps.
Formula  SR = tasks\_solved  tasks\_total. Report relative gain  (SR\_C ‚àí SR\_A)  SR\_A.

Stability  mean time to failure or successful rollback factor.
Option A  Stability = MTTF\_C  MTTF\_A.
Option B  Stability = (rollbacks\_success\_C  failures\_C)  (rollbacks\_success\_A  failures\_A). Report as multiplier.

Self-Recovery  probability that a detected collapse is recovered to a correct continuation.
Formula  Self-Recovery = recoveries\_success  collapses\_detected  here 0.87 means 87 percent of collapses are repaired.

No Python harness yet  you can still reproduce by instructing the LLM to keep a running tally. Example rubric prompt for the scorer:

```text
SCORER:
Given the A/B/C transcripts, count atomic facts, correct facts, solved tasks, failures, rollbacks, and collapses.
Return:
ACC_A, ACC_B, ACC_C
SR_A, SR_B, SR_C
MTTF_A, MTTF_B, MTTF_C or rollback ratios
SelfRecovery_A, SelfRecovery_B, SelfRecovery_C
Then compute deltas:
ŒîACC_C‚àíA, ŒîSR_C‚àíA, StabilityMultiplier = MTTF_C / MTTF_A, SelfRecovery_C
Provide a short 3-line rationale referencing evidence spans only.
```

This scorer can be the same LLM running in a second tab. For higher reliability, run three seeds and average.

## üî¨ Engine at a glance

Vectors and metrics  I and G, Œ¥\_s = 1 ‚àí cos(I,G) or 1 ‚àí sim\_est, sim\_est is mean of entities relations constraints.
B = I ‚àí G + k\_bias, E\_res = rolling\_mean of absolute B over 5.
Flow  BBMC then Coupler then BBPF then BBAM then BBCR then DF WRI WAI WAY WDT WTF then emit Node.
Policy  stop when Œ¥\_s < 0.35 or 7 nodes, bridge only if Œ¥\_s drops and W\_c < 0.5 Œ∏\_c, never invent facts when Œ¥\_s above boundary.

## üß™ Community scoring guidance

Publish your task list five domains short but non trivial.
Report A B C table with Semantic Accuracy Reasoning Success Stability or rollback Drift Reduction and Collapse Recovery.
Include OneLine uplift score 0 to 100. Do not include human readability for OneLine.
Add a three line rationale.
