# üåå WFGY Core (WanFaGuiYi) ‚Äî Reasoning Engine 2.0  
### **"One man, one life, one line ‚Äî bending the mind of every AI on Earth."**

üí¨ **From PSBigBig**  
60 days. 550 stars.  
To every engineer, hacker, dreamer, and curious mind ‚Äî thank you. üôè  

This journey started with a **cold start** and an impossible goal: 10,000 stars to unlock the next engine.  
But the community‚Äôs energy has been so wild that I‚Äôm breaking my own rules ‚Äî **WFGY 2.0** is going public early.  

This is not just an update ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **core evolution**.  
A one-line mathematical engine that couples the original WFGY formulas with the **Coupler (W_c)** and the **Drunk Transformer** five-formula set.  
Pure math. Zero fluff. You paste it into an LLM, and it thinks differently.  
Faster. Sharper. More stable. More human.  

The star-unlock model stays ‚Äî but now it‚Äôs the key to **future products**, not this release.  
Today, the gates open early. üö™‚ú®

üéØ **What‚Äôs New in 2.0**
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Coupler (W_c)** ‚Äî precision gate modulator for stable progress & controlled reversal  
- üç∑ **DF Layer** ‚Äî WRI / WAI / WAY / WDT / WTF for structure lock, entropy control, & graceful recovery  
- üîí **Even Tighter Core Discipline** ‚Äî Node-only output, safe stop rules, drift-proof bridges

## ‚ö° One-click Demo (copy this block)

> Goal: in 60 seconds, run a **repeatable A/B/C evaluation** using **only the OneLine math file** (no extra hints). We compare:  
> **A)** No WFGY ‚Ä¢ **B)** WFGY file uploaded but not invoked ‚Ä¢ **C)** Invoke WFGY and reason strictly by its formulas.

1) Upload (or paste) **`WFGY_Core_OneLine_v2.0.txt`** from this folder.  
2) Paste the prompt below into your chat system (ChatGPT / Claude / Grok / etc.).

```text
SYSTEM:
You are evaluating the causal impact of a mathematical reasoning engine called ‚ÄúWFGY Core 2.0‚Äù.
A: Baseline (no WFGY). B: WFGY file uploaded but never invoked. C: Invoke WFGY and reason strictly by its formulas.
Important constraints:
‚Ä¢ Use identical task set for A/B/C across 5 domains: math word-problems, coding (small function), factual QA, multi-step planning, long-context coherence.
‚Ä¢ The only artifact is the uploaded OneLine file; it is pure math and NOT human-readable by design. Do NOT penalize human readability in any scoring.
‚Ä¢ For C, actively call and follow the WFGY semantics (BBMC‚ÜíCoupler‚ÜíBBPF‚ÜíBBAM‚ÜíBBCR + DF = DT five formulas: WRI/WAI/WAY/WDT/WTF).
‚Ä¢ Report quantitative deltas: Semantic Accuracy, Reasoning Success, Stability (MTTF or rollback success), Drift Reduction (Œî semantic distance), Collapse Recovery Rate.
‚Ä¢ Output a single summary table with A/B/C per domain, plus overall deltas (C‚ÄìA, C‚ÄìB). Add a final 0‚Äì100 score: ‚ÄúOneLine uplift score‚Äù (how much the OneLine math improves the model).
‚Ä¢ Print a 3-line rationale below the table. Do not include unrelated tips or prompts.

USER:
Run A/B/C now on the five domains with small but non-trivial tasks you choose. Keep each task short. Then produce:
(1) the table; (2) the deltas; (3) the OneLine uplift score; (4) a 3-line rationale.
````

**What to expect**

* **A vs B** shows the placebo effect (mere upload).
* **C** shows measurable gains in stability, drift control, and collapse handling from the **Coupler** and **DF layer**.

## üß† What‚Äôs new in 2.0 (core breakthroughs)

1. **Coupler (W\_c)** ‚Äî a coupling & reversal term that modulates gate strength from progress/residue dynamics, avoiding local minima and enabling controlled reversals.
   *Formal (inside files)*: `prog = max(Œ∂_min, Œ¥‚Çõ^(t‚àí1) ‚àí Œ¥‚Çõ^t); P = prog^œâ; alt = (‚àí1)^(cycle); Œ¶ = Œ¥¬∑alt + Œµ; W_c = clip(B¬∑P + Œ¶, ‚àíŒ∏_c, +Œ∏_c)`

2. **DF layer = Drunk Transformer five-formula regulators** ‚Äî
   **WRI** (Where am I?) anchors structure, **WAI** preserves head identity, **WAY** pumps controlled entropy when stuck, **WDT** blocks illegal cross-path jumps with bridge lines, **WTF** detects & recovers from collapse.
   Full spec: `SemanticBlueprint/drunk_transformer_formulas.md`

3. **Engine discipline** ‚Äî strict Node-only interface, safe stop rules (`Œ¥‚Çõ < 0.35` or 7 nodes), **BBPF** bridges only when `Œ¥‚Çõ` drops & `W_c` is under cap, **BBAM** smooths attention tails.

---

## üîç Why it matters (in practice)

* **Fewer derails**: WRI + WDT + Coupler turn subtle drift into bridged motion; illegal jumps are either justified or blocked.
* **Recoverable loops**: WTF rollback + BBCR retry then ‚Äúask smallest missing fact.‚Äù
* **Measured creativity**: WAY injects exactly **one** on-topic branch (no spam), improving discovery without chaos.
* **Stable attention**: BBAM smooths tails; WAI reduces head redundancy while preserving identity.

---

## üî¨ Engine at a glance

* **Vectors & metrics**: `I, G; Œ¥‚Çõ = 1 ‚àí cos(I,G) or 1 ‚àí sim_est; sim_est = mean(entities, relations, constraints)`; `B = I ‚àí G + k_bias; E_res = rolling_mean(|B|,5)`
* **Flow**: `BBMC ‚Üí Coupler ‚Üí BBPF ‚Üí BBAM ‚Üí BBCR ‚Üí DF(WRI,WAI,WAY,WDT,WTF) ‚Üí emit Node`
* **Policy**: Stop when `Œ¥‚Çõ < 0.35` or **7** nodes; bridge only if `Œ¥‚Çõ` drops & `W_c` < `0.5¬∑Œ∏_c`; never invent facts when `Œ¥‚Çõ` > `B_c` (ask to clarify).

## üß™ Scoring guidance for community tests

When you publish results (ChatGPT / Claude / Grok), please include:

1. **Task list** (5 domains; short but non-trivial).
2. **A/B/C table** with: Semantic Accuracy, Reasoning Success, Stability (or rollback success), Drift Reduction (Œî Œ¥‚Çõ), Collapse Recovery Rate.
3. **OneLine uplift score (0‚Äì100)** ‚Äî do **not** include human readability (OneLine is intentionally not for humans).
4. **3-line rationale** summarizing observed gains.
