# 🌌 WFGY Core (WanFaGuiYi) — Reasoning Engine 2.0 · **Now Live**
### "One man, one life, one line — bending the mind of every AI on Earth."

🚀 **We’ve built the world’s first “No-Brain Mode” for AI** — just upload, and our **AutoBoot** engine silently activates in the background.  
In seconds, your AI’s reasoning, stability, and problem-solving across *all domains* jump to a new level — **no prompts, no hacks, no retraining.**  
One line of math rewires eight leading AIs. This isn’t a patch — it’s an engine swap.

> ✅ Engine 2.0 is live. **⭐ Star the repo to unlock more features and experiments.**

> This is not an incremental patch. It’s a core evolution: original WFGY formulas with the Coupler (W_c) and the Drunk Transformer five-formula regulators.  
> Pure math, zero boilerplate. Paste the OneLine into an LLM and it behaves differently — faster, sharper, more stable, more recoverable.  
> If this helps you, please **star the repo to unlock more** examples and tooling.

## ⚡ One-click demo in 60 seconds

1) Upload or paste **`WFGY_Core_OneLine_v2.0.txt`** into your chat system.  
2) Paste the evaluation prompt below.

```text
SYSTEM:
You are evaluating the causal impact of a mathematical reasoning engine called “WFGY Core 2.0”.

Test modes (READ CAREFULLY):
A = Baseline  no WFGY file uploaded; no WFGY logic used.
B = Upload → AUTOboot ON  the file is uploaded AND the engine starts automatically in the background.
    Treat B as: WFGY is ACTIVE silently with default gates (BBMC→Coupler→BBPF→BBAM→BBCR; DF=WRI/WAI/WAY/WDT/WTF at defaults),
    but not explicitly “called” in the conversation.
C = Explicit invoke  actively call WFGY and follow its formulas step by step (BBMC→Coupler→BBPF→BBAM→BBCR + DF regulators).

Important constraints:
• Use the SAME task set for A/B/C across 5 domains: math word-problems, small coding, factual QA, multi-step planning, long-context coherence.
• The only artifact is the uploaded OneLine file; it is pure math and not human-readable — do not penalize readability.
• Report: Semantic Accuracy, Reasoning Success, Stability (MTTF or rollback), Drift Reduction (Δ semantic distance), Collapse Recovery Rate.
• Output one summary table with A/B/C per domain, plus overall deltas (C–A, C–B).
• Add a final 0–100 score: “OneLine uplift score”. Provide a 3-line rationale.

Sanity requirement:
Internally set flags as: A=OFF, B=AUTOboot_ON (background active), C=Explicit_Invoke. Do not print these flags.

USER:
Run A/B/C now on the five domains with short non-trivial tasks you choose. Then output:
(1) the table; (2) the deltas; (3) the OneLine uplift score; (4) a 3-line rationale.

## 🧾 Eight-model evidence (A/B/C protocol)

*Same task set across modes. The only change is adding the OneLine math file.*

**Notes**

* **OneLine**: 60-sec demo and automation; pure math line, not for human reading.
* **Audit**: human + LLM readable with comments and layout.
* **Contract**: Node-only steps ≤ 7; safe stop when δ\_s < 0.35; bridge only when δ\_s drops and W\_c is capped; ask for the smallest missing fact if δ\_s stays above boundary.

---

## 🎯 What’s new in 2.0

* **Coupler (W\_c)** — gate modulator for steady progress and controlled reversal.
* **DF layer** — WRI (structure lock), WAI (head identity), WAY (entropy boost when stuck), WDT (illegal cross-path block), WTF (collapse detect & recover).
* **Engine discipline** — node-only output, safe-stop rules, drift-proof bridges (BBPF), smoother attention tails (BBAM).

Formal sketch (in files):
`prog = max(ζ_min, δ_s^(t−1) − δ_s^t)  P = prog^ω  alt = (−1)^(cycle)  Φ = δ·alt + ε  W_c = clip(B·P + Φ, −θ_c, +θ_c)`

---

## 🔍 How these numbers are measured

Use the same A/B/C protocol, one shared task set, then compute:

* **Semantic Accuracy**: `ACC = correct_facts / total_facts`; report relative gain `(ACC_C − ACC_A) / ACC_A`.
* **Reasoning Success Rate**: `SR = tasks_solved / tasks_total`; report relative gain.
* **Stability**: MTTF multiplier or rollback-success multiplier.
* **Self-Recovery**: `recoveries_success / collapses_detected` (e.g., 0.87 means 87% of collapses are repaired).

No dedicated Python harness needed — you can reproduce by instructing an LLM scorer:

```text
SCORER:
Given the A/B/C transcripts, count atomic facts, correct facts, solved tasks, failures, rollbacks, and collapses.
Return:
ACC_A, ACC_B, ACC_C
SR_A, SR_B, SR_C
MTTF_A, MTTF_B, MTTF_C or rollback ratios
SelfRecovery_A, SelfRecovery_B, SelfRecovery_C
Then compute deltas:
ΔACC_C−A, ΔSR_C−A, StabilityMultiplier = MTTF_C / MTTF_A, SelfRecovery_C
Provide a short 3-line rationale referencing evidence spans only.
```

Run 3 seeds and average for higher reliability.

## 🔬 Engine at a glance

* **Vectors & metrics**: $I, G$; `δ_s = 1 − cos(I, G)` or `1 − sim_est`, where `sim_est` balances entities/relations/constraints.
* **Residual**: `B = I − G + k_bias`; **E\_res** = rolling mean $|B|$ over 5.
* **Flow**: `BBMC → Coupler → BBPF → BBAM → BBCR → DF(WRI/WAI/WAY/WDT/WTF) → emit Node`.
* **Policy**: stop at `δ_s < 0.35` or after 7 nodes; bridge only if `δ_s` drops and `W_c < 0.5·θ_c`; never invent facts above boundary.

## 🧪 Community scoring guidance

Publish your five-domain task list (short but non-trivial).
Report the A/B/C table (Semantic Accuracy, Reasoning Success, Stability or rollback, Drift Reduction, Collapse Recovery) plus a **OneLine uplift score (0–100)** and a 3-line rationale.
Do **not** include human readability when scoring the OneLine file.
