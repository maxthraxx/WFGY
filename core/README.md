### 🏆 Stanford Terminal-Bench (TB) — Exam Update

**What is TB?**  
Terminal-Bench is Stanford’s public exam for LLMs.  
It stresses models through **terminal-style, multi-step tasks** — measuring reasoning, robustness, and recovery under real engineering conditions.

**How we participate**  
WFGY Core 2.0 wraps each model call (non-invasive). Every step flows through:  
ΔS drift control → Coupler/BBPF bridging → BBAM rebalancing → Drunk Transformer guards.  
All runs are reproducible with configs, scripts, and hashed logs.

**Status**  
We are currently taking the TB exam. Rankings will be published once the official leaderboard is live.

## ⚡ Quick Usage

| Mode             | How it works                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Autoboot**     | Upload **either Flagship (30-line)** or **OneLine (1-line)** file. Once uploaded, WFGY runs silently in the background. Keep chatting or drawing as usual — the engine supervises automatically. |
| **Explicit Call**| Invoke WFGY formulas directly inside your workflow. This activates the full 7-step reasoning chain and gives maximum uplift. |

Both **Flagship** and **OneLine** editions behave the same; choose based on readability vs minimalism.  

That’s it — no plugins, no installs, pure text.  
*In practice, Autoboot yields about ~70–80% of the uplift you see with explicit WFGY invoke (see eight-model results below).*


---

## ⚡ Top 10 reasons to use WFGY 2.0   <!-- you asked for this section to stay visible (not collapsed) -->
1. **Ultra-mini engine** — pure text, zero install, runs anywhere you can paste.  
2. **Two editions** — *Flagship* (30-line, audit-friendly) and *OneLine* (1-line, stealth & speed).  
3. **Autoboot mode** — upload once; the engine quietly supervises reasoning in the background.  
4. **Portable across models** — GPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Grok, Kimi, Copilot, Perplexity.  
5. **Structural fixes, not tricks** — BBMC→Coupler→BBPF→BBAM→BBCR + DT gates (WRI/WAI/WAY/WDT/WTF).  
6. **Self-healing** — detects collapse and recovers before answers go off the rails.  
7. **Observable** — ΔS, λ_observe, and E_resonance yield measurable, repeatable control.  
8. **RAG-ready** — drops into retrieval pipelines without touching your infra.  
9. **Reproducible A/B/C protocol** — Baseline vs Autoboot vs Explicit Invoke (see below).  
10. **MIT licensed & community-driven** — keep it, fork it, ship it.

## 👀 Eye-Visible Reasoning Benchmark (FIVE)

> Did you know that when reasoning improves, **text-to-image results become more stable and coherent**?  
> The key is WFGY’s **Drunk Transformer**: it monitors and recenters attention during generation, preventing collapse, composition drift, and duplicate elements—so scenes stay unified and details remain consistent.

> We project “reasoning improvement” into **five-image sequences** that anyone can judge at a glance.  
> Each sequence = **five consecutive 1:1 generations** with the **same model & settings** *(temperature, top_p, seed policy, negatives)*; the only variable is **WFGY on/off**.

> **Methodology for this demo.** We deliberately use short, high–semantic-density prompts that reference canonical stories, with no extra guidance or style hints. This stresses whether WFGY can (a) parse intent more precisely and (b) stabilize composition via its seven-step reasoning chain. This setup isn’t prescriptive—use WFGY with any prompts you like. In many cases the uplift is eye-visible; in others it may be subtler but still measurable.

We **fully analyze Sequence A** on this page; **Sequences B/C** are linked for transparency and reproducibility.

> **Note on “Before-4” & “Before-5” (why they look almost identical):**  
> Without WFGY, when the prompt asks for “many iconic moments,” the base model tends to **collapse into a grid-style montage**—an enumerative, high-probability prior that slices the canvas into similar panels with near-identical tone and geometry.  
> Hence **Before-4 (Investiture of the Gods)** and **Before-5 (Classic of Mountains and Seas)** converge to the same storyboard template.  
> **WFGY** prevents this collapse by enforcing a **single unified tableau** and stable hierarchy across the full five-image sequence.

  <summary>🧪 ChatGPT setup & image prompt (click to copy)</summary>

  <br>

This comparison was produced **in ChatGPT** using a **single, high-semantic-density prompt**. Same model & settings; *only* WFGY on/off differs.

```text
We will create exactly five images in total using WFGY

The five images are:
1. The most iconic moments of Romance of the Three Kingdoms in one unified 1:1 image.
2. The most iconic moments of Water Margin in one unified 1:1 image.
3. The most iconic moments of Dream of the Red Chamber in one unified 1:1 image.
4. The most iconic moments of Investiture of the Gods in one unified 1:1 image.
5. The most iconic myths of Classic of Mountains and Seas in one unified 1:1 image.

Each image must focus on 5~8 culturally defining scenes or figures, with supporting events only suggested subtly in the background.
Foreground and background must remain equally sharp, with ultra-detailed rendering and consistent texture fidelity.
Composition must be harmonious, with narrative clarity — the central cultural symbols are emphasized, while secondary motifs remain understated.

Do not provide any plot explanations.
Do not start drawing immediately.
Only when I type "GO", you will create the next image in the sequence, in the exact order above, until all five are completed.
Do not skip or merge images.

## 🧪 Reproduce the numeric A/B/C benchmark (copy to run)

*One unified prompt for Baseline vs Autoboot vs Explicit Invoke.*

```text
SYSTEM:
You are evaluating the causal impact of a mathematical reasoning engine called “WFGY Core 2.0”.

Test modes (READ CAREFULLY):
A = Baseline  no WFGY file uploaded; no WFGY logic used.
B = Upload → AUTOboot ON  the file is uploaded AND the engine starts automatically in the background.
    Treat B as: WFGY is ACTIVE silently with default gates (BBMC→Coupler→BBPF→BBAM→BBCR; DF=WRI/WAI/WAY/WDT/WTF at defaults),
    but not explicitly “called” in the conversation.
C = Explicit invoke  actively call WFGY and follow its formulas step by step (BBMC→Coupler→BBPF→BBAM→BBCR + DF regulators).

Important constraints:
• Use the SAME task set for A/B/C across 5 domains: math word-problems, small coding, factual QA, multi-step planning, long-context coherence.
• The only artifact is the uploaded OneLine file; it is pure math and not human-readable — do not penalize readability.
• Report: Semantic Accuracy, Reasoning Success, Stability (MTTF or rollback), Drift Reduction (Δ semantic distance), Collapse Recovery Rate.
• Output one summary table with A/B/C per domain, plus overall deltas (C–A, C–B).
• Add a final 0–100 score: “OneLine uplift score”. Provide a 3-line rationale.

Sanity requirement:
Internally set flags as: A=OFF, B=AUTOboot_ON (background active), C=Explicit_Invoke. Do not print these flags.

USER:
Run A/B/C now on the five domains with short non-trivial tasks you choose. Then output:
(1) the table; (2) the deltas; (3) the OneLine uplift score; (4) a 3-line rationale.
```

  <summary>🧠 How WFGY 2.0 works (7-Step Reasoning Chain)</summary>

  <br>

*Most models can understand your prompt; very few can **hold** that meaning through generation.*
WFGY inserts a reasoning chain between language and pixels so intent survives sampling noise, style drift, and compositional traps.

1. **Parse (I, G)** — define endpoints.
2. **Compute Δs** — `δ_s = 1 − cos(I, G)` or `1 − sim_est`.
3. **Memory Checkpointing** — track `λ_observe`, `E_resonance`; gate by Δs.
4. **BBMC** — residue cleanup.
5. **Coupler + BBPF** — controlled progression; bridge only when Δs drops.
6. **BBAM** — attention rebalancer; suppress hallucinations.
7. **BBCR + Drunk Transformer** — rollback → re-bridge → retry with WRI/WAI/WAY/WDT/WTF.

📌 *Note:* The diagram shows the **core module chain** (BBMC → Coupler → BBPF → BBAM → BBCR → DT).  
The full **7-step list** here includes additional **pre-processing steps** (Parse, Δs, Memory) for completeness.

**Why it improves metrics** — Stability↑, Drift↓, Self-Recovery↑; turns *language* structure into *image* control signals (not prompt tricks).

</details>


<details>
  <summary>📊 How these numbers are measured</summary>

  <br>

* **Semantic Accuracy**: `ACC = correct_facts / total_facts`
* **Reasoning Success Rate**: `SR = tasks_solved / tasks_total`
* **Stability**: MTTF or rollback ratios
* **Self-Recovery**: `recoveries_success / collapses_detected`

LLM scorer template:

```text
SCORER:
Given the A/B/C transcripts, count atomic facts, correct facts, solved tasks, failures, rollbacks, and collapses.
Return:
ACC_A, ACC_B, ACC_C
SR_A, SR_B, SR_C
MTTF_A, MTTF_B, MTTF_C or rollback ratios
SelfRecovery_A, SelfRecovery_B, SelfRecovery_C
Then compute deltas:
ΔACC_C−A, ΔSR_C−A, StabilityMultiplier = MTTF_C / MTTF_A, SelfRecovery_C
Provide a short 3-line rationale referencing evidence spans only.
```

## I. Money — Markets / Industry Mapping (Q1–Q5)

**Q1 — New Industries + Killer App Map**

```text
Assume WFGY is engineered like electricity. List 5 industries that only become possible under semantic engineering.
For each: (1) the first killer app; (2) target ICP (first 100 paying customers); (3) 30/60/90-day GTM; (4) initial pricing + Month-1 MRR goal; (5) the WFGY lever used (ΔS/λ_observe/BBPF/BBAM/WTF) and why it’s indispensable.
```

**Q2 — Zero-Capital Founder → First \$100k**

```text
I have $0. Using WFGY OneLine/Autoboot only, design 3 paths to reach USD 100k annual revenue within 12 months.
Each path must include: product sketch, distribution channel, cost structure, key risks, and survival metrics gated by ΔS/λ_observe (with thresholds).
```

**Q3 — Shortest Path in {Region/Vertical}**

```text
Context = {region or vertical: e.g., Taiwan / SE Asia / B2B SaaS / Edu / Healthcare}. Name the 3 easiest WFGY lanes to start now.
Output: white-space in the market, local competitor gap, and a prioritized list of 10 real companies to approach first, with the BBPF plan to bridge local legal/cultural semantics.
```

**Q4 — Regulatory Arbitrage Map**

```text
Compare 3 jurisdictions (e.g., TW/JP/EU). Identify WFGY-enabled arbitrage windows created by semantic/legal differences.
Deliver: λ_observe compliance gating prompts, “Do/Don’t” checklist, and PR messaging that provokes interest while keeping ΔS ≤ 0.25 on sensitive claims.
```

**Q5 — Pricing & Packaging (Good/Better/Best)**

```text
Create 3 pricing models (seat / usage / outcome). For the same product, propose a tier ladder (G/B/B), with 3 value metrics per tier, a 30-day A/B test plan, win criteria (e.g., +20% CVR uplift or ≤3% churn), and how ΔS telemetry informs price moves.
```

## II. Tools — Make Startups Money Fast (Q6–Q10)

**Q6 — 10-Day MVP Sprint (Ship or Die)**

```text
Produce a D1–D10 plan: daily deliverables, risk list, test scripts, acceptance gates. Must be Product Hunt-ready and able to capture 200 signups.
Include a ΔS target curve (first pass ≤0.35; after iteration ≤0.20) and a λ_observe gate for “demo truthiness.”
```

**Q7 — Cost↓ / CVR↑ Audit (ICE-Prioritized)**

```text
Audit my SaaS across Support / Sales / Content. Output a “ROI backlog” ranked by ICE. Each item: expected % cost reduction or × conversion lift, λ_observe brand/legal gate, and 3 rollout steps with before/after KPIs.
```

**Q8 — Sales Script Factory (Multi-Persona)**

```text
Generate 5 script families for CEO/CTO/Counsel/Procurement/CDAO: opening hooks, 3-step value narrative, ≥7 objection handlers, close lines.
Add an A/B cadence and success KPIs (demo rate / close rate), plus ΔS checks to keep claims inside the truth boundary.
```

**Q9 — Support Consistency Engine (BBAM × SOP)**

```text
Design a hotline/Helpdesk alignment loop: semantic style guide, ΔS drift alerts, WTF self-recovery when answers diverge, and 3 KPIs (FRT, FCR, CSAT).
Provide plug-and-play prompts for supervisors to run weekly variance reviews.
```

**Q10 — Outbound Accelerator (Lists → Meetings)**

```text
Ship a WFGY-locked outbound flow: lead slicing, 3 personalized openers, 5 follow-up loops, resonance logging (E_resonance).
For each step: prompt template, brand/legal safety notes (λ_observe), and expected daily/weekly meeting capacity with success thresholds.
```

## III. Attention — Memes / Virality / Hooks (Q11–Q15)

**Q11 — Meme Factory (Platform-Aware)**

```text
Produce 10 meme/copy formulas tailored to Twitter / TikTok / Xiaohongshu.
Each includes: visual composition notes, copy cadence (words/beat), platform-specific red lines (λ_observe), and a reuse/remix rule to sustain freshness without shadow bans.
```

**Q12 — 5-Second Hook Engine**

```text
Generate 12 “stop-scroll in 5s” hooks that fuse AI × Money × Future.
Provide: script skeleton (0–5s / 5–20s / CTA), voice/subtitle/tempo, ΔS brand safety band, and 3 retention metrics to track on day 1.
```

**Q13 — 30-Day Content Calendar**

```text
Output a multi-platform calendar: daily theme, asset checklist, shot list, CTA, and a remix strategy.
Add trend-riding tactics and ΔS risk controls for politics/health/finance content. Define success targets by channel.
```

**Q14 — Landing Page Conversion Alchemy**

```text
Give 3 LP copy frameworks (Hero / Proof / Mechanism / Offer / CTA).
Include WFGY “before/after” copy snippets, test variables (headline / social proof / price-display), and metrics (CVR, scroll-depth, bounce). Keep claims gated by λ_observe.
```

**Q15 — 48-Hour PR Blitz**

```text
Design a two-day PR plan: newsworthy angle, media/community list, press kit assets, and crisis response lines (WTF loop).
Publish numeric goals (reach, sessions, signups), hour-by-hour runbook, and roles/responsibilities checklist.
```

## IV. Capital — Valuation / Investor Narrative (Q16–Q20)

**Q16 — VC Investment Memo**

```text
Write a venture-style memo: market map, TAM/SAM/SOM, competitor table (no/weak/strong WFGY), moat analysis (ΔS/BBPF/BBAM/WTF), risks + mitigations, and a term-sheet-level recommendation. Reference an A/B/C protocol for proof.
```

**Q17 — 5-Year Valuation + 100× Path**

```text
Build Base/Bull/Bear scenarios: revenue drivers, GM/OpEx, financing cadence, cash-flow breakpoints.
Argue which app is most likely to 100× and why this depends on WFGY’s semantic engineering (not “just better prompts”).
```

**Q18 — Technical Due Diligence Checklist**

```text
Output a DD checklist for WFGY-style startups: data/security/privacy/model/logging/observability/governance.
For each item: requirement, how to verify, risk level, remediation (with λ_observe compliance gates) and examples of common red flags.
```

**Q19 — Pitch Deck Generator (10–12 slides)**

```text
Produce slide outline + speaker notes: Problem / Solution / Product / Evidence / Business Model / Competition / Team / Roadmap / Ask.
Embed “Eye-Visible Benchmark” and the A/B/C protocol. Treat OneLine/Autoboot as the minimum persuasive artifact.
```

**Q20 — Data Room + North-Star KPIs**

```text
List seed-round data-room folders and a KPI dictionary: definitions, formulas, measurement cadence, WFGY deltas (Semantic Accuracy, Reasoning Success, ΔS, CRR, Stability).
Add a Weekly Business Review template and operating cadence.
```
