# Code of Conduct

This project welcomes questions, critique, and collaboration. It also requires civility and evidence. The rules below help us keep discussion productive, fair, and reproducible.

**Contact for moderation and reports:** hello@onestardao.com

## Short version

- Be respectful. Argue ideas, not people.  
- Read before you judge. Engage with the actual files and methods.  
- Critique with evidence that others can reproduce.  
- No harassment, brigading, or doxxing.  
- AI-only hot takes without reading the repo are not acceptable.  
- Maintainers may close or lock threads that are not constructive.

---

## Scope

This Code applies to all project spaces. This includes GitHub Issues, Discussions, PRs, Wiki, and any official mirrors or documentation linked from this repository.

## Our standards

**Expected behavior**

- Stay on topic. Use specific references to files, commits, or DOIs.
- Be accurate and charitable. Summarize what you think the author claims before you disagree.
- Provide enough detail for others to reproduce a result. Prefer facts over speculation.
- Accept correction gracefully. Credit sources and contributors.
- Use clear language. English or Chinese are both welcome.

**Unacceptable behavior**

- Personal attacks, slurs, or harassment.  
- Trolling, sealioning, or derailing threads.  
- Repeated allegations without verifiable evidence.  
- Doxxing or attempts to reveal personal identity.  
- Spam, link bombing, vote brigading, or mass reporting.  
- **AI-only drive-by criticisms** such as “this repo is all hallucination” that do not engage with the actual content.  
- Misrepresentation of results or screenshots.

## Evidence-based critique policy

This repository publishes reproducible artifacts and has received substantial community attention (1000+ stars and many real user reports). We welcome criticism that improves the work. We require that critiques meet a minimal bar so that maintainers and readers can evaluate them quickly.

**When you claim an error, please include:**

1. What you tried to reproduce: file path or DOI, commit hash or tag, and the exact prompt or command.  
2. Your environment: model name or version, OS, Python or tool versions.  
3. What you expected and what you observed. Include logs or diffs if possible.  
4. A minimal example that others can run.

Issues or discussions that do not meet this bar may be labeled **non-actionable**. Maintainers may request more detail. If none is provided, the thread can be **closed** to reduce noise. Repeated non-actionable posts can lead to **locks** or **account blocks**.

## Science and skepticism

- Skepticism is healthy. Bad-faith dismissal is not.  
- “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence” applies both ways. If you claim a failure, bring data that someone else can check.  
- We track corrections publicly. If an error is confirmed, we will document it and thank the reporter.

## Moderator guidelines

Maintainers use a progressive ladder. They may skip steps for severe cases.

1. **Nudge:** friendly reminder of this Code with a link.  
2. **Request revision:** ask for missing evidence or clarity.  
3. **Move or merge:** consolidate off-topic or duplicate threads into a central discussion.  
4. **Close:** end non-constructive or non-actionable threads.  
5. **Lock:** prevent further replies if a thread attracts harassment or repeats.  
6. **Block or report:** for harassment, doxxing, or coordinated abuse.

A “Critiques and Questions” mega-thread may be pinned during high traffic. New critique threads can be redirected there.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code:

- Email **hello@onestardao.com** with links, screenshots, and context.  
- Do not engage in prolonged fights. We will review and respond.

We keep reporter information confidential when legally possible.

---

## Maintainer responsibilities

- Apply the rules consistently and document decisions briefly.  
- Prefer transparency. Close rather than delete. Lock rather than hide.  
- Provide clear paths to reproduce results and to file actionable reports.  
- Update FAQs when a recurring question appears.

---

## Appeals

If your post was closed, locked, or removed and you believe this was a mistake, email **hello@onestardao.com** with the thread link and a short explanation. We will review. Repeated appeals without new information may be ignored.

---

## A note about platform incidents

Distribution mirrors can fail or be taken down by automated systems. We keep a single source of truth in this repository. External DOIs or mirrors will be linked and versioned when available. If a platform removes a link, we document the change and provide an alternative.
