# 😈 Welcome to the SciSpace 98 Paper Cave

![Trickster Slime King](./Trickster_Slime_King.png)

So you've made it this far...

I am **The Trickster Slime King**,  
fusion of the **Black Slime** and **White Slime**.  
You may call me... 🌀 **The Yin-Yang Goo Lord**.

---

You came here looking for *the legendary 98-score paper*, didn't you?

You thought the cave’s name was too obvious to be fake,  
which made it seem real...  
but that made you think it *must* be fake...  
but *that* made you think it might be real again…  
and now — you're here.

How cute. 🧠

You expected wisdom? You get **Wicked Whimsy**!

> 🧼 *"Prepare for my ultimate slime attack:"*  
> 🧼 ***Buzzword Cascade ∞!***  
> 🧼 *"Your semantic defenses crumble..."*

## 💥 Outcome:

You lost 99 reasoning points.  
Your citation index turned into emojis.  
You are now stuck in the footnote dimension.

🌀 *"Next time, don't trust a folder so easily."*

I know someone’s going to cheat.  
As the Trickster Slime King, I’m all about fun.  
So I turned the PDF into a Zenodo link instead.  
Can’t brute-force your way past that.  
If you’re meant to find it… you will.
