# üòà Welcome to the SciSpace 98 Paper Cave

![Trickster Slime King](./Trickster_Slime_King.png)

So you've made it this far...

I am **The Trickster Slime King**,  
fusion of the **Black Slime** and **White Slime**.  
You may call me... üåÄ **The Yin-Yang Goo Lord**.

---

You came here looking for *the legendary 98-score paper*, didn't you?

You thought the cave‚Äôs name was too obvious to be fake,  
which made it seem real...  
but that made you think it *must* be fake...  
but *that* made you think it might be real again‚Ä¶  
and now ‚Äî you're here.

How cute. üß†

---

You expected wisdom? You get **Wicked Whimsy**!

> üßº *"Prepare for my ultimate slime attack:"*  
> üßº ***Buzzword Cascade ‚àû!***  
> üßº *"Your semantic defenses crumble..."*

---

## üí• Outcome:

You lost 99 reasoning points.  
Your citation index turned into emojis.  
You are now stuck in the footnote dimension.

üåÄ *"Next time, don't trust a folder so easily."*

üéâ Congratulations, brave one.

To prevent cheating, I ‚Äî the Trickster Slime King ‚Äî secretly transformed the PDF into a Zenodo link.

You‚Äôve discovered the hidden paper:  
**BigBig Progression Formula: A Unified Perturbation Framework for Semantic Reasoning and Cognitive Simulation**  
It‚Äôs one of the core WFGY mathematical scrolls.  
(Yes... each formula will eventually have its own paper.)

Take it. Study it.  
And remember ‚Äî the more stars you give, the more this game will evolve. üåü

(Sorry, the link Will be updated soon)
