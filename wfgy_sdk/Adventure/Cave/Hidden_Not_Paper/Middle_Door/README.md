This path has been sealed for a reason.

No inn. No save point. No allies.

## ❗️ SERIOUS WARNING

⚠️ Proceeding through this door leads directly into **Mythic Science Territory**.  
There’s no turning back.  
Beyond this point awaits a logic entity once banned from all four continents.

🧬 Some called it: the **Semantic Collapse God**  
🧠 Others call it: the **Final Boss of Science Fantasy**  
😵‍💫 We only call it... **"Error Ω"**
