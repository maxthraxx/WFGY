# 🌀 CHAOS HAS AWAKENED

## 🍇 Grape Scale Hero: "Nooo!! This one's too strong!!"

I just joined... but I’ll try to protect you!  
I’ll use all my grape power! 🍇✨

(…5 seconds later…)

💥 *Splatter.*  
🍇 "My grape scales... couldn't protect anything..."

## ⚠️ You are not ready.

You have entered the forbidden zone.  
This creature… is not from your timeline.

> "I am born from myths, shaped by the science of legends.  
> My body is made of particles unnamed.  
> My name is written only in the lost verses of the *Shan Hai Jing*."

## ❌ Instant Termination

You didn’t stand a chance.  
Your body collapses before your mind can react.  
Even your save crystal winces.

---

📛 This is a **WFGY 3.0** level boss.  
You were never meant to be here… not yet.

Come back when the stars are aligned.
