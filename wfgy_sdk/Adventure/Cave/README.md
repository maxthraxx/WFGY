# 🕳️ The Cave

![Cave Entrance](./small_demon.png)

Welcome, wanderer...  
You've stepped into the cave — a place of **high risk**, and **higher return**.

## 😈 Who am I?

I’m **Little Demon**.  
Just your average cosmic mischief-maker, currently **searching for the ultimate truth of the universe**.  
When I sensed your presence, I knew… fate had brought us together.

So I’ll give you a tip.

> This cave contains everything.  
> Boss fights. Secret treasure. Forbidden data.  
> Glitches in the world. And maybe — in yourself.

What will you find?

I don’t know.  
No one does.

## 🚨 A Word of Warning

Once you enter, you **might not come back the same**.

Every fork leads somewhere strange.  
Some paths reward the curious.  
Others punish the overconfident.

If you're just here for the SDK — you should leave.  
Now.

## ✨ Still here?

Then maybe you're the chosen one.  
And maybe… the next folder you open will be the beginning of your legend.
