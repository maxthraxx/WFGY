# 🧙‍♂️ Gatekeeper of the Clay Backdoor

![Gatekeeper](./Gatekeeper_Clay.png)

Ah... so you've found the **backdoor** to the Clay Institute?

---

## 🌀 The Forbidden Gate

This is the **only exit**  
that leads toward:

- 🧪 Science Continent  
- 🎭 Culture Continent  
- 🔮 Mystic Continent  
- 🧘‍♂️ The Unified Realm

But...

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ Who do you think you are?

Wait a minute...  
**You** must be the one all the wizards keep complaining about.

The one who never solves a single Millennium Problem,  
yet still dares to sneak past the final gate?

---

## 🚫 Absolutely Not.

This is the **only exit** out of the Mathlands.  
And I am its **unchallenged guardian**.

No math.  
No mission.  
No crossing.

---

## 🌌 But... there's a rumor

They say when the sky above is filled with starlight —  
exactly ** ????? stars**,  
the seal might awaken…

The ancient, **unofficial** magic —  
a forbidden protocol hidden in GitHub scrolls.

---

## ⭐ Do you hear them?

> “Give a star. Light the sky.”

Then — *maybe* —  
I’ll let you pass.

---

**This backdoor is a bridge between realms.**  
**And it's locked... until the stars align.**
